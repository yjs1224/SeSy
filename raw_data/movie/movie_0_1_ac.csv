this is a great film very original,0
8 stars for the movie and 3 stars for the dvd,0
the combat scenes you guessed it over the top,0
but since i must include at least 10 lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer,0
if your going to make a movie about wi maybe spend a few minutes there first,0
and everything happens in an often barely discernible gloom even indoors,0
you will thrill when you hear colman rouse that rabble of low degree even if he does n't sing,0
the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word film itself,0
they should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script,0
and the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression without tightening up,0
it goes way overboard to make every character have a serious hang up about something and of course there is jane curtain 's mental illness oh thats always a great subject to laugh about,0
at least it did n't have the jiggling handheld camera syndrome,0
just imagine what carpenter can do with a hollywood level budget,0
in the first one night in the tropics the boys were purely there for comic relief and played a very small part in the film,0

i kept waiting for someone to bust out a bull whip,0
i had watched this as a kid but not being much of a jerry lewis fan i had completely forgotten it,0
you can also ask them to show it on television,0
i think the movie suffers from a lack of sex and violence though there is one car chase stunt that looks so dangerous it could only have been filmed in a country where life is cheaper than beer,0
at lot of that is due to the subtlety of the sound it does not overpower or try to manipulate it merely stays mostly in the background and enhances the suspense rather than detract,0
watching moreau 's portrayal through these transitions lends a reallife atmosphere to the proceedings and is the primary delight of this film,0
i am a very big jim carrey fan,0
i truly appreciate scarlett johansson 's work and lord knows that she tried her best here,0
because despite the title it 's a poor excuse to make money off the scifi channel,0
i reviewed this movie as part of a project at the library of congress,0
if anyone wants a copy private message me,0
the ups and down of a family,0
the premise was decent but the acting was wooden and some of the scenes were really ridiculous,0
it is also terribly slow,0
the movie is nothing short of a masterpiece,0
ring 2 does precisely that,0
it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful,0
many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was,0
yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it 's too slow it 's so boring so many silences but i think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl the granddaughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni,0
i rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy,0
along the way you find that the path toward true innovation not as encouraged as one would expect or we would probably be driving cars on some form of extremely plentiful natural gas today,0
moon child combines scifi drama and action with the perfect cast and talent to create the most sensationally moving movie of the time and great for most audiences,0

i ca n't believe this guy had the chutzpah to think he should have been selected to play 007 rather than pierce brosnan,0
this is a great movie kids will love and i suspect the low score here may be due to animal activists who feel chimps should not snowboard,0
their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world 's people a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today,0
bettany plays gangster 55 as a young man and malcolm mcdowell fills the role thirty years later,0
boy i never knew how bad a movie can be but after watching about 20 minutes of this piece of s i do,0
then of course the opening scene was of a tranquil lake outside some castle in europe and people began making very mocking barf sounds that was probably the most memorable thing of the whole movie,0
the most obvious flaw horrible horrible script,0
my architect also covers the difficulty louis kahn had with getting his designs accepted,0
i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the chupacabra and it broke loose on a cruise liner,0
tammy is a young college student still living with her folks,0
it does not need cgi sound effects or unreal characters,0
the darker moments were somewhat creepy this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe which gave me nightmares,0
in fact the whole courtroom scene was masterfully done,0
a mad function that celebrates confusion of life and cinema not even a bit of fun in the middle of the way,0
john cusack as ed has the most interesting role followed closely by ray liotta 's rhodes,0
the mild blue content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag as is the violence,0
if it smells like and it looks like well you know the rest,0
shivers is considered to be his first proper film i personally liked shivers much more than the rest of cronenberg 's early films like the brood scanners for instance,0
whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school,0
umberto lenzi manages to ensure that all of the major players are interesting and lenzi also ensures that all are guilty in one way or another which ensures that everyone deserves what they get by the time it finishes,0

trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power,0

another guy giving it a high rating for this beep just to be contrary,0
pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw,0
all interested in foreign film film in south america argentina will like this film,0
still straight and straightened out,0
the direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying comeuppance at the end,0
you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie,0
twenty four year old robert downey jr renders a delightful performance ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend,0
don activates the scepter and in a blinding flash the turtles are gone,0
sounds bleak but it is n't,0
a great start to an unbeatable comedy,0
the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on,0
the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up,0
in the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movie 's cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting,0
the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful,0
these scenes are often competent and occasionally they 're good but in the context of the film they have little dramatic impact,0
i was thinking a long time about that,0
how many movies do we have to watch about children 's sports that are n't exactly the same thing as the last,0
he redefines what the term evil villain means,0
everyone in our theatre was laughing and gasping the whole way through not only were some of the stunts creative but some of the stuff they did took us completely by surprise,0
what i realized is that if you read the back of this video box it tells you the whole story seriously the whole thing,0
it 's time to get old william claude back where he belongs,0
plus the whole ideal of a being clean was real nice,0
this is a very stylish film with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene giving it a very strange look,0
he showed just the right amount of emotion and yet he made the viewers understand his feelings,0
there 's a story here of course but it 's obvious that the main intention of the project was to showcase the talents of the stars and some very mediocre songs by irving berlin and to dazzle the audience by filling the wide screen with brilliant colorful images,0
the novelty of the concept flourishes with intelligence and vision but it felt like something you would find in an episode of the twilight zone,0
if woody wants to win his fans back then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated not insulted,0
that 's it no plot no motive just blair witch tree shots and torture,0
we then have to wait for holmes to play catch up,0
this is one of the funniest film 's of disney 's live action library,0
it is true that there does not seem to be a clear focus in this film,0
and a shirtless oily middleaged often overacting charlton heston does n't exactly shout hero or academy award,0
i recommend parents sit with their younger children to watch this as it can be quite suspenseful for them,0
the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity for no apparent reason and she still follows him around like a puppy,0
definition of donkey punch a mediocre film trying desperately to make itself memorable by basing things around one scene that will stick in your mind for a while,0
to keep him quiet burns promises becker a percentage of his income,0
as one of the posters said just when you think he ca n't sink any lower he does,0
between these are below the average nearly bad as a movie,0
the acting is poor the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode,0
sadly it 's already too late for me,0
the depths this wonderful actress went to create her character in a realistic light should be applauded,0
id rather see that than this pile of trash,0
zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie,0
my finger was worn out by the movie 's end having to continually raise and lower the volume,0
may he live to compose forever and always assisted by the great bruno nicolai an accomplished composer in his own right,0
nice well if you are into that sort of thing this movie still would n't be anything for you,0
god how i wish shoot to kill was one of those films,0
finally there is the pacing of eastwood 's direction,0
it 'll give you ideas on what to do next to spark up your relationship,0
ex if you had n't read the book you think what the heck happened to mary 's first husband,0
the point to this film is in its texture and in the ultimate fates of bart and egg,0
candace bergen as the mayor of new york is totally unbelievable,0
i love this film you ca n't not do if you like any of adam sandler 's,0
and this actress does seem to have a few chops herself,0
though discrete there was strong sexual connotation,0
it 's the job of the 1 doctor 1 nurse and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects,0
what a privilege it was for a small town girl to experience this,0
all the pieces just fell into place and you can tell that she 's a great writer from what she did with this script,0
most of the characters were either italianamericans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks,0
that 's something i cannot believe,0
also the casting of a young richard long and a very young natalie wood was a stroke of genius,0
i knew that before i saw the film,0
sure they used various actors for batman but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape,0
i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources,0
hong 's film would 've looked like art house snobbery in action if not for the fact that it 's made in a very straightforward manner focusing mainly on the most basic of emotions,0
brilliant because of its social overtones,0
grant was nominated for his first academy award as best actor for his heartwrenching portrayal of a man that seems to repeatedly lose everyone he ever cares about,0
america ferrara has a very brief role in this film do n't just see it for her,0
she is the only reason i did not bestow a rating of 1 on this movie,0
told in crisply dated vignettes the film progresses through the depression and world war i as it offers tom and brother mike taking separate paths under the watchful eye of ma powers,0
a guy who idolizes hugh hefner,0
so do go see it,0
the only thing i did n't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode,0
and a remarkable one it is literally and figuratively,0
i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back,0
this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released,0
on its surface the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny and the girl carrie that bix meets who would like to look out for him,0
for reasons i do n't understand mgm which held the rights to the student prince did not make a sound version until 1954 odd when you consider that during the thirties they had allan jones under contract who would have been wonderful in the part,0
excellent movie i will recommend it to friends and try to see a few more charlotte rampling movies,0
william powell and myrna loy,0
anyways the plot has potential it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points,0
but let it be known you 'll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of american independent filmmaking this year,0
it has many of the same qualities as the first series,0
two identical servants scrub the floor,0
i will also avoid mentioning the spoton satire office space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe,0
it 's horrible do n't watch this movie,0
he 's ok as dracula but much better as the wolf man,0
go rent the navigator or the love nest by buster keaton now those are comedy classics,0
i knew i was going to see a low budget movie but i expected much more from an alex cox film,0
instead of a gun you 're more likely to see him with a drink in one hand a cigarette in the other a beautiful woman to ogle and a quick quip,0
half way through i turned it off in bored disgust,0
mifune is classic samurai and bronson is the funniest i have seen him in the many films i have watched,0
i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clich and an awful one at that,0
if john candy or bill murray did police academy they could make it work,0
after this death scene i already gave up on the movie and started to irritate myself more and more about small things that went wrong,0
el charro himself although dumber than jason the hockey mask boy has a couple of nice scenes and a certain presence,0
well it is and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere,0
crackle basket i think that something bad is about to happen,0
try it maybe you 'll like it probably you wo n't,0
while watching the film i could see many of the similarities but hey casablanca has inspired countless imitators so take that for what it 's worth,0
i approached this film with an open mind and was interested in the way it began,0
and i also liked at the dance how angus told rick off that was a good scene and the rest of this movie was just as well filled with laughs and pity for angus and troy,0
marriage is not easy and the road that this couple travels together hits home with us,0
seeing it with a crowd that was enjoying it with me the families that had brought their children the applause at robin 's first appearance and at key moments of the film added to the joy and excitement at seeing it in a theater,0
i just could n't stop my tears even though the film has a happy end,0
and the director expects everyone to laugh because hey it 's robert de niro and that 's funny,0
the film is still going on in my back but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time i think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons but its the only i liked,0
maybe that 's wrong of me,0
the movie is a moody portrayal of what people can do to each other when they are frightened,0
the club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up,0
the mole people look especially stupid but at least there clothes look more normal than the elves,0
mark leaves sara and travels to paris with his assistant alan thompson but the plane crashes and he dies,0
any movie should have an idea simple or more complex it needs one the problem with fragata it 's once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasons they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind,0
the choke is a slasher produced supposedly as a straighttodvd movie,0
screamers was a last choice rental,0
van dyke with a witty and poignant screenplay,0
back in the 1960 's those of us who were bad movie aficionados thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time,0
now i know why this country has so many issues,0
he thinks he is fine despite having a nagging and materialistic fiance to augment the nagging of his materialistic and emptyheaded mother,0
do not watch this movie,0
the film consists of the audition tapes of the surrender girls and some footage from previous films,0
rather it is a comic film within the martialarts genre and in fact one of the best ever made,0
though there are only a few characters i did n't find it difficult to keep my attention the the story and as for the story it 's basic and realistic,0
when the screenwriter actually wants the two unrequited lovers to unite he uses a pretty unbelievable deus ex machina technique,0
if it were n't for the immortal story popping up once on tcm and by chance getting to tape it i'm not sure if i would ever see the immortal story due to its lack of circulation,0
pi stops him and provokes him,0
the line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin so i leave it to you to decide whose fault makepeace 's performance in this is,0
ozon lets us see his characters directly and then through the mind of charlotte rampling 's character,0
to that end there was actually some real footage of the eruption mixed in there somewhere,0
in the movie prince was n't known as prince but as the kid,0
i was n't able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just were n't catchy at all,0
after this steve should really consider to either stop acting or wait for a decent script to come along,0
sure this is n't his prime and his voice is n't as strong as usual but hes full of energy and charisma,0
there are definite problems with character development as well in fact it hardly seems to exist except for possibly one character,0
how come he did n't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley,0
for those who have not watched this show yet this anime is based on popular digital novel created by and amateur writer,0
i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min,0
the director and writer mark jones certainly had the intention of making a film with black humor but his heavy hand made actually an unpleasant and annoying movie but never funny,0
who at the comedy channel puts these shows on tv,0
there 's no gimmickry or theme it 's just your typical simpsons episode in setup,0
i do n't know if this classes as a spoiler but the guests are n't real like in ali g or anything they 're played by one man or so i believe,0
dry cleaners scene is legendary,0
you will notice a lot of comments for grim reaper saying rachel is a stripper but she never takes her clothes off is more of an exotic dancer,0
a snow ball in hell would have a better chance than i would at my age,0
today the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive that robes they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources,0
not only that the verbal jokes are funny but also the drawings are silly enough to make my flat mate laugh who is n't into cartoons at all,0
this movie is n't bad if your comparing it to wesley snipes' dtv movie the detonator,0
allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she does n't realize how much danger she really is and it 's all erroll 's fault,0
ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune,0
c aubrey smith too is just marvelous as the crotchety old grandfather who finds his stubborn hardhearted icy exterior being worn away just by being in the presence of such a terrific young lad who loves him unconditionally,0
girard perfectly executes what it should be,0
get her back or you 'll lose a ton of viewers,0
the film is pretty bloody consider that it have been made in 1972 the effect are cheap but they have been made with style and the some of the actors are really great,0
however i 've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try,0
the film is obviously as lowbudget as they come but this does n't hurt the film too much since it 's put together rather well by director frank r strayer and his crew,0
i thought the idea of the movie was good but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot,0
alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother,0
the final scene in the house on sorority row has to be listed as one of the best and the clown of midnight also ranks highly amongst the greatest madmen 's costumes,0
let us drink a toast to the great jobs you did in the movie,0
in conclusion fingerprints is one of those subpar horror movies that you stumble upon at 3am whilst browsing through late night television,0
i was most tickled by the casting of a flamboyantly gay actor to play the rightwing religious zealot brother,0
the movie starts with the bang and it stay with the same pace till its end,0
same era 1936 but much better script and storyline,0
and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy,0
was n't the woman played by kay lenz,0
this one is the most fast paced and exciting and not all that bad either,0
it 's a jaws ripoff about a mysterious black car that appears one day in a desert community and starts killing the townspeople,0
all of the acting and characterizations were fine and on target,0
the story seems to me an extremely low budget version of the shining and takes place mostly in a cheap motel room,0
there is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring,0
and if you 've never been exposed to the comic book this movie will give you an entertaining way to be exposed to its message about fear hatred and prejudice,0
this is the real modesty blaise,0
it 's a great premise for a murder story and hitchcock gives strangers on a train a run for all its worth with the help of walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any hitchcock film including anthony perkins in psycho,0
they act like you or me would act in situations like that,0
having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago i can say that there is little if anything from the original book,0
of course their guns are no match for her wrench,0
the idea has been planted,0
on the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden,0
the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film,0
more than a few people in this world felt passionately enough about this thing to write it direct it shoot it rehearse it finance it etc etc,0
as an original audience member of both productions i have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to sparkle as well as in saturday night fever fame flashdance and the offbroadway smash hit mama i want to sing,0
a very disturbing show that you cannot stop thinking about for at least weeks after watching it,0
clea duvall is wonderful and really makes you care about her and relate to her,0
simon owns a store in the middle of nowhere that sells nothing,0
the ending 's the worst no matter what you 'll come out wanting your money back,0
generally not as scary as the eye but the imagery in this is more sickening than most of the things in the eye,0
it takes a very special quality to be able to make people laugh and james performance in this movie definitely shows us he has just that talent and skill,0
storywise i found this film somewhat lacking,0
it is probably the worst movie ever made,0
her life is not so simple as it seems however,0
tears of the black tiger is a one of a kind western from thailand,0
as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series,0
even if you are not stay away,0
sad when cheyenne left sad when the dam series ended,0
again just bad directing on that,0
the leading actors are robert cummings and priscilla lane although director alfred hitchcock wanted gary cooper and barbara stanwyck in the roles which would have given the movie more stature,0
as if in a parody of the argentina of the 80 's the government wants to steal the children from her for some hideous purpose,0
there is also no resolution,0
perhaps one of them was supposed to evolve into the dragon,0
one day leeds goes to a hamburger diner,0
everything is wrong the acting is terrible especially the female lead is painfully to watch,0
this is the best animated version of the hoary old dickens tale ever brought to the screen,0
this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50 's scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50 's scifi cmovie,0
it references other movies but does n't really spoof them,0
by now this is almost a trite story kid finds animal pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the pet winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family,0
mediocrity runs a frightening level,0
christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women i 've ever seen on screen,0
no vacancy has three main stories,0
robert redford directs this film and tells the story of the maclean 's through the perspective of the older brother norman norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love with what this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman,0
sanjay dutt plays a police officer who gets caught up in the proceedings and also involved are a bandit and contractor 's father,0
mainly because they have n't fired at the soldiers yet,0
the acting writing and production values are topnotch,0
as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year,0
in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it 's been given,0
before i wrap this up i 'd like to say everyone involved in this film did very well,0
granted i have n't seen this movie in quite some time but i had to drop by and defend it 's honor after reading some of the others reviews written about it,0
placing sylvia chang the role of a typical singaporean housewife is a bad choice,0
well apparently john dahl has found a way,0
was this a kid 's cartoon,0
and so is maintaining innocence,0
bottom young ones were legendary tv series' and it was about time they made a film,0
however there were some good elements to make the film compelling and to grab the attention,0
worse is the total lack of a believable setting or narrative,0
the cartwrights are a hard working prosperous and honourable family highly respected in those parts,0
everything about it okay i 'll go through this systematically,0
it is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer 's block,0
i have heard of shoestring budgets for making movies this one is beyond broke,0
it is over the booth that i always sit in when i eat there,0
now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts,0
if anyone out there is listening please make this available again,0
oh and if you 're lucky some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you 'll get inverted upside down reversed adverts,0
for now this movie stays a relic of my boyhood past and for good reason,0
and there were aspects of the interaction of art and commerce there were explored,0
in most of the indian movies the songs always have lyrics about what is happening to the characters,0
i do n't need to watch it next year because i know who 's going to win,0
it 's so italian that most of the time the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than italian itself,0
the cinematography is terrible the acting is laughable the special effects make plan 9 from outer space look like spiderman the story is trite derivative and stupid,0
anyway i did n't realize that the movie was a musical,0
this show dared to show a more accurate portrayal the longterm effects the desperation for a fix and the ugliness of it all was n't glossed over,0
or a steven bochco joke,0
if you want to see an uplifting horse movie go rent sylvester,0
eerie intelligent and underrated this undeservedly maligned movie is well worth checking out by general horror film fans and hardcore hammer aficionados alike,0
i cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers,0
the story is so laughable that it 's pathetic,0
the makers of lenny understood bruce though,0
i am pretty sure that she relied on her own childhood in rome for inspiration,0
i hope his career recovers,0
avoid this movie anyway you can,0
saw it on ae last night and the only thing that drew me in was the curiosity of how much worse it might get,0
the subpar performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to really anything here,0
well worth seeing and it 's criminal that the dvd is out of print,0
how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me,0
he certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end,0
in high sierra bogart meets a simple kind old man with a crippled granddaughter who needs an operation,0
and it had one of the most anticlimactic endings that i 've seen for a long time,0
however it looks to me like this is the same actress that played the first murdered prostitute in the movie,0
this movie was n't good,0
these bmw films have all been exceptional,0
the phrase polishing a turd springs to mind,0
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and gymkata happened to be on i watched way too much of it,0
the best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in venice italy,0
everyone tries their best but the film lays there like a melodramatic lump,0
the plot is believable with mcraney packing up his family and just saying to hell with it all after being subjected to so many disappointments and incidents since his return from vietnam years earlier,0
jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in,0
he was brilliant in boogie nights and i loved his performance reign over me,0
the character duke is an absolute puke in this film,0
everything in this cartoon is so wonderful nature music and the characters are so sweet,0
but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy,0
the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations,0
anybody who has n't guessed the surprise ending of this one by five minutes in deserves what he gets,0
why is this not on dvd,0
it was like a bad sitcom pilot that went on for way too long,0
all released before 1948 they give one a true sense of oldtime cinema,0
which is an oxymoron as the story had no plot,0
i was confused when i ran across this on the hotel tv,0
do n't bother with this just watch one of the first three again just remember the good times the killer puppets would return in the terrible spinoff flick puppet master vs demonic toys,0
avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing,0
for the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters,0
i am not sure whether the author intended to give this interpretation to the story but i believe it fits perfectly,0
i think the people who just reject this film out of hand should really rent american pimp or some other documentary on prostitution,0
although enid is in no hurry to grow up and get on with things rebecca senses an inevitability to her life,0
connery 's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was,0
the acting was average at best but a really poor performance by the daughter of adam sandler 's character,0
so why is almost everyone dumping on it so much,0
well last time i checked the only perfect person died on a cross,0
rosie schwartz has seen it all before,0
which makes it all the more appealing to me,0
almost 10 years later i am dealing with the same things in high school and it is conveyed in the most upfront way,0
this lowbudget film is fun if you 're a john krasinski fan but is otherwise disappointing,0
how convenient and unbelievable can you get,0
many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters,0
it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this,0
jim henson needs to take a long look at himself as i believe he has been truly outdone here by master craftsmen,0
it was masterful storytelling combining a deeply personal search for identity with a historical retelling of a national disgrace,0
unlike those however this travesty has zero humor and very little heart,0
then more pseudo scientific theorizing and discussion about what they should do with occasional acid flashback inserts,0
that ca n't be right,0
i had watched this movie years ago and for some reason i taped it,0
however it was loud and never seemed to blend into the story,0
when they escape they both ca n't stand each other and have opposite goals,0
i never have got why this show was so popular,0
wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late 60s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years,0
until it 's completely undercut by one of the most rapid character reversals ever conceived for a major film,0
i first saw the movie on cable and found it to be a very funny movie,0
in a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish,0
i think you will enjoy it if you enjoy a good psychological study,0
for what it 's worth hudson and hathaway do the best they can with what they have to work with with hathaway 's performance a bit more wellrounded due to her character actually being given a chance to develop somewhat,0
but when it 's this cheap you can clearly see where love holds it together,0
the movie remains a bit theatrical but norman jewison has done wonders with the material,0
overall a climax of blue power certainly wont be everyone 's cup of tea but if you like your rough seventies porn with a story this is probably one of the better examples,0
if a spaghetti western fan and a hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together this one would be the perfect compromise,0
so see it for yourself examine the current legal system and find your voice at the end of this moral journey,0
after the first episode i was discouraged now that i have seen two episodes i give up,0
the editing could have been tighter,0
it is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder,0
promising power control and immortality they inexorably deliver helplessness chaos and death,0
one area that was surprisingly decent was some of the makeup on the zombies it was n't great we 're not talking george romero here but it was good considering the quality of the rest of the movie,0
okay it 's not exactly gone with the wind or a great comedy but this is a very cute movie,0
ever notice how one of palance 's sidekick the little oriental guy has an old telephone receiver strapped onto his ear as a hearing aid,0
if you can wrap your head around the era recognize that churning out b movies does n't necessarily mean poor quality as a standard and be thankful that wayne does n't sing in this one rainbow valley,0
i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered,0
there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people,0
it goes honey today a pastor came to the base and talked to us guys about accepting jesus as our lord and savior she pauses for dramatic effect and finishes with and i did it sweetheart i have accepted jesus christ as my lord and personal savior,0
the movie made a lot of money for the studio and gave people the first opportunity to see what sound could be like in the movies,0
the film contains standard structure with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story 's style and the character 's motives sets up a fastpaced theme of action but lacks depth and strong character introduction,0
so eddie stars in jack 's films under the pseudonym of dirk diggler,0
all the production value that money can buy cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development or good acting,0
what was he thinking of,0
i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 bw producers' showcase televised version,0
what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing,0
what a waste of 2 hours i will never get back,0
i was pleasantly surprised with the film 's predecessor white lightning,0
an inappropriately titled dramatically unsatisfying vampire mystery,0
this is oldschool filmmaking along the lines of taxi driver or the verdict,0
that 's the first half the second half deals with a group of monks who find a half dead robinson who wandered to their door and they nurse him back to health,0
al pacino is not an action hero anymore,0
really though its just too soppy for me,0
bob is married to carol,0
also the sound design has no lack,0
my only problem is that sometimes it can be pretty low budget sometimes actors change and you just have to deal with it like sabrina 's father is 2 different guys throughout the course of the movie i mean could n't they just say he was an uncle or something,0
sadly the screenwriters of bay 's films are often overlooked,0
some of this material landed somewhere between comic book and schizophrenic dementia,0
it 's just hitting the payperview scene in canada and i beg you do n't rent this one,0
will nanu find that he likes america and wants to stay,0
basically the problem is you watch this movie to see a girl kick butt with a yoyo and you get maybe ten minutes of that with a whole lot of random other stuff getting in the way,0
however it made me start to think about the world we 're living in and the power the media has to affect peoples meanings and opinions,0
this engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms,0
the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising,0
hazel agrees and takes the doctor with her,0
but what 's the most amazing about age of innocence are the colors,0
i had a really hard time making it through this move,0
the episodes had neat tricks in them,0
at times it is hard not to get carried away with admiring the beauty of the locations shot composition and miseenscene at show here,0
it could be for everyone of course but this film is clearly aimed at particular audiences,0
it would have been more interesting as a buddy movie with tennant and gallo getting into mischief than a poorly played out romantic comedy,0
after 2 days of courting her he decides to leave lina,0
he does give in and lose himself because money and opportunities show up,0
i felt like i was watching a badly made home video,0
also the soundtrack was too loud and too cloying like something from a 1940 's radio soap opera,0
throughout this short the position of the baggage car changes on the train either 3rd 4th or 5th and in long shots not at all,0
these characters do and say nothing funny,0
the mother character is even more reprehensible,0
the other is petulia recently married to a very cold fish,0
awful terrible dire etc etc do n't know if i 'll be watching again,0
frankly i did not think there was anything humorous about this movie,0
this film had me at somewhat of a loss but i still liked it,0
overall the monster club is watchable for its stars and for the decent last story but i can certainly not recommend it,0
soso acting effects decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack,0
as in films of this type everyone around russell is dying but when he attempts to kill channing he 's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses,0
myra breckinridge does n't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty,0
this might just scar little kids in to not playing with chattering teeth toys but i know some kids that this would n't scar,0
i love the quirky ensemble cast shows and a great setting always helps,0
how much will the lawyer actually help his client usually it is nothing unless it lends itself to the implausible story line,0
this is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike,0
i thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend,0
but my favourite is the rather timid attempt of catherine deneuve to sing she brings it the way she is with lots of grace and modesty at the same time very tempting,0
the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone,0
i hate these stupid female victim roles,0
she was the link between the male and the female and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about,0
why the hell am i watching this,0
and i may be being generous,0
she actually looks younger seven years later in witness for the prosecution,0
rushing inside he grabs the briefcase only to find someone closing the gate to her plane,0
i would buy a copy if it were on dvd and it is too bad it is n't,0
although i 've never been fond of the term i ca n't say i 've met many people who 've seen this film without my recommending it to them,0
3 the only way you can appreciate a true story is when hollywood turns it into a feature film,0
minority report is very good but also very disturbing the fact that this film was a pg13 or a 12 in england is shocking,0
this is on the comedy shelf of my film library,0
final grouping movies probably would 've skipped this one,0
in fighting movies i usually do n't care about story at all,0
toby stephens i found just ok helen graham 's brother not very good,0
the story was accurate and the movie was well made,0
no one will ever buy this,0
jake 's embittered by his situation and not the most likable person as a result,0
being his social inferior louise thought she could improve herself by going all the way with him,0
i love this band and the dvd was even better than i had hoped for believe me if you took the time to read this thread you need this dvd,0
i enjoyed the show as a kid,0
in the end i give this film a 3 out of 10 why 3 why not 1,0
janet has come out to her mother already but cara 's parents are still in the dark about their daughter 's homosexuality,0
the film is terrifyingly bad with awful characters awful acting and an awful end,0
without spoiling the movie i ca n't give you anymore information about this i guess you 'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself,0
not terrible but certainly not good,0
i went to the video store to rent the original movie which i caught the last half of on cable not too long ago and loved,0
the good points the special effects are reasonable and the set designs are excellent the bad points cliche after cliche hits you until you ca n't take it seriously,0
for a year that was fueled by controversy and crap it was nice to finally see a film that had a true heart to it,0
the musical score is excellent and really accentuates the terror and emotional impact of the whole movie,0
there are of course some really dud science facts in here but is n't that always the case,0
another minor problem i feel is that many of the philosophical concepts were overtly and therefore unnecessarily stated when the story itself should have been allowed to put forward these concepts,0
independence day scenes where you snuff out some memorable landmarks in a fireball,0
i loved the storyline too as i said up there i could relate and it 's rare you find a film you can completely relate to,0
some of the scenes are too much and some scenes are a little dull but mississippi burning is a gripping film whether you like it or not and the two hours will seem really short,0
there are lots of far better bad movies out there,0
and unlike most films of the time the focus was not on a goal but just on the events and lives of the seaman aboard the glencairn,0
there will always be people complaining about the winners,0
set smack dab in smalltown flagwaving america director michael ritchie who scored critical points the year before in the littleseen but deadon satire smile hits a boxoffice home run this time always keeping things popping and managing to toss in a few interesting curve balls in the plot to keep it from falling into a typical root for the underdog comedy,0
seriously that one blond chick 's voice had me wincing in pain constantly,0
i liked it better than memento although this was perhaps due to the lower expectations,0
along the way he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa 's,0
lotus root for love eternal and so on,0
exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme,0
on the right side sean hannity tends to nitpick about whether or not guests literally answer his question in a yes or no when he could be talking about the actual issues,0
for now i live with the vhs incarnation,0
what is shocking and wild in college rarely holds up over time and this is proof,0
after searching the video store for 10 minutes i settled onto this little gem of hollywood barf,0
he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena 's close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971,0
in the end then i think this movie stacks up pretty well to other films in the universal series,0
the sister says i want to give you a big french kiss but i ca n't because it will arouse you and your head will explode,0
there was plenty of humor in this film that lightened the mood including the bar 's owner who found a great way to defend himself from the rat people with none other than a frying pan,0
overall madman is an uneven film but for it 's genre it is surprisingly well filmed if not well acted and very suspenseful,0
this was such a great movie i am left speechless,0
yul brynner and kirk douglas bring intensity to their roles,0
that 's another reason this film is so good,0
the only good thing i can say is that for a person who has not read the book this movie is kinda alright,0
if such a distinguished panel ca n't see or care about the obvious storytelling problems of battlestar galactica then what worth is their award,0
then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and onscreen events leave you reeling,0
also check out the director 's version just to see the cut footage from the beginning of the film and some comments from james cameron on his sfx work for the film,0
the delta burke vs william conrad heavy weight battle was also good,0
this is what happens when you try to adapt a play from the theater,0
he was named nero after his adoption,0
first is his use of space,0
i also found myself lost at a few parts due to two reasons,0
world 's finest is excellent and in my book counts as a superhero movie,0
boy did i know about that show,0
the script is filled with stupid situations just for the sake of blowing something up,0
if america 's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef,0
it almost sounded like blackmail they not only could win the competition this night but very possibly win the million dollars but only if they got rid of mom and dad,0
sorry to me this movie has no entertainment value at all,0
i 've said enough here,0
you know there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film,0
nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to vonnegut 's depiction of a man who has lost all for love,0
the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and that 's about the best thing i can say for it,0
i ca n't recommend it enough and feel if you give it a chance you 'll feel the same way,0
great production design appealing stars great lines,0
the detective came back to that house the second time and went directly to the place where the box was stored,0
it is n't supposed to but it does,0
by the time bones awakens and starts killing those who wronged him the film has settled into a tight supernatural revenge flick with a nod to the blaxploitation genre,0
but once she 's there nothing even remotely interesting happens,0
plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end,0
within an abandoned rural farmhouse stargher locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies,0
since the past couple of days i'm really hooked on the female scorpion series and i keep hitting myself over the head because i waited until now which is way too long before purchasing the whole box set,0
it stands as a classic underrated film and a fond memory of my childhood,0
the only people who could possibly like this show are the hopeless preteens who have nothing better to with with their time and do n't really know the meaning of quality yet,0
there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion,0
it should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this,0
too bad the show never fully explored this iconic figure,0
state of grace has all the violence foul language and hotheaded characters that are part and parcel of this sort of film but at its core is a very well worked plot bolstered by some great characterisation,0
i was disappointed to see stripperella go but several months later i found out about new episodes that aired at like 100 am,0
the fight scenes well they are a bit of fun,0
you have the vote use it wisely,0
or the fbi and his only support outside the building is from weary street cop al powell,0
it adds nothing to the movie,0
i enjoyed the movie 's story the characters and the actors were not bad,0
its like holocaust movies that are guaranteed an oscar nomination irrespective of their merits,0
the scene when he is trying to record a last message is quite good,0
he should know jeff is bisexual and seems more interested in robert 's sword than his pen,0
although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man,0
this movie is one of the few movies that pauly shore really excels in with some of the funniest lines i 've ever heard,0
they played around with the original script and characters and generally screwed the whole thing up in my opinion it was a mess,0
it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the halfhearted citizen kane like narrative structure is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out,0
a slasher stalks kids at a well at a cheerleader camp slaughtering them in the macabre ways introduced in the friday the 13th series,0
oh for some unexplained reason micheal 's eye 's turn red,0
cheri christian just does n't make an effective julie,0
the surreal trial which dissolves from bw back into rich technicolor once the verdict is announced may well be a dream but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome,0
it is n't the whole story hollywood added a certain sensationalism when the film was made,0
none of these attempts to add drama or suspense made me hold on to the edge of my seat,0
the film makes no claim to authenticity but the settings and costuming invariably feel more right than many more highly acclaimed efforts,0
so that being said this gets a solid 8 that is an 8 out of 10 for b zombie movies,0
among them are herbert fenton a fellow oxford student of drake 's actress june preston unknown to drake but requested by him to attend ralph percy the chief designer at kirby 's aircraft company and keith jeffrey kirby 's stock broker,0
but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in bad taste it 's clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has talent,0
dennis hopper the director wo n't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir i do n't think,0
in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it 's obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator,0
tom hanks is my favorite actor so this film has a special place in me,0
i saw this movie and it really is not great,0
even after you have read all of this if you have not seen it the curiosity will get the better of some of you and you will watch it to see how bad it really is,0
fast black is one juicy character and morgan brings life into it,0
perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this illadvised film,0
but lo and behold when performed and only then shakespeare comes to life,0
by the way that 's another film that i think is overlooked,0
this is n't the best bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the scifi channel this is quality stuff,0
in a nutshell it was awful made worse by the fact that it could have been quite brilliant,0
do n't worry just shove some footage from the first movie in a new box and someone will actually see it,0
if you want to see jet li playing a vigilante superhero in a mission impossible style movie black mask' delivers,0
i really had hopes that masterpiece theatre would do it right,0
he has a flair for the kind of moment that can sum up a lifetime,0
hackman turns in a decent performance as he usually does he has a good scene with dunaway and a number of good lines with o 'donnell,0
the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches,0
as a final note i commend the performer who portrayed tobias,0
the basic storyline is this,0
the young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history the dysfunctional family considers reopening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex,0
i would suggest the basketball diaries if i was going to suggest a movie about drugs,0
though there are some sporadically nicely shot scenes and of course an interesting score by ennio morricone this movie does n't offer anything new or interesting to the genre,0
why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list,0
the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour,0
for a start the cgi rats are awful the attack sequences feature handheld jerky camera movement really quick edits to try hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there,0
you do n't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right,0
i would have found some place in the film to put this scene,0
to with i'm gonna take leave of the fire station,0
you see the original film had a simple ending with a great message,0
though some scenes seems a little long at times this film will be a heavy oscar contender,0
the movie also lacks in tension and the main characters in the story are handled in a boring and bad way,0
i'm sure there are no killer ants in that hill wrong,0
i hope this group continues making films,0
but the best part of the show is new york city,0
i seriously hope they actually read the horrible story before agreeing to it,0
to say more would spoil some of the jokes so you must see it for yourself,0
but hang on a minute i heard someone say the other day that 95 of the world 's population do n't think that they are infants that the world has not progressed to adulthood,0
i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie,0
the lingerie and sex toys company that targets female consumers said its adverts aimed to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality,0
i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation,0
this is the one inescapable fact that extremist films such as this would never willingly admit to,0
schneider can at least console himself for having not concocting the storyline,0
it is n't enough to save the film though it 's still a piece of rubbish,0
i think i watched every single episode of it and whenever an episode was over i thought this show sucks yet i always came back,0
but then we would not have had a movie then would we,0
but everyone who acted in this movie pulled off good performances,0
a very small range of the ideological can be conveyed silently,0
even watching it during the day time it scared me just as much,0
with about four minutes to go i shut the dvd player off and went for a walk,0
sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering,0
i highly recommend this and the other dvds in this series,0
it 's all a bit confusing,0
do n't make the same mistake i did,0
this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment,0
the opening titles were trimmed removing kolchak 's whistling and the closing credits well there were none,0
as morbid as it may sound the show is really funny as the rest of the cast adds some real flavour to the central character,0
we learned for example that they had taken human form and had to remain in that form while on earth or they would die,0
my biggest objection to this movie however was that it is the exact opposite of a feelgood movie,0
what kept we watching was the characters the movie starts with some pretty grim troubled people gathered together to try and fight one of their basic fears fear of water fear of swimming,0
i'm more interested in the mindset of those who would waste their life watching this kind of nonsense in the first place,0
i do not pan it with a complete lack of stars as i found malcolm mcdowell 's performance to be one of the most unique i have ever seen and that deserves credit but i can say without a doubt that 'a clockwork orange' will be far displaced from my viewing screens for a good few years until i am up to the challenge once more,0
my only regret is i 've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs,0
i am going to keep this brief if you value the use of your time this is one to miss,0
if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two,0
i wo n't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs,0
and david friedman as a freak show barker is not to be missed,0
on the other hand i think the camera does a fine job trying to capture the best angles in order to show the deep core in the story and the settings helps a lot to the looks and mood full of dark nights gray skies and very cold buildings,0
this plot line is inexplicably discarded by boyce,0
elvis remains one of the top ten madefortv movies of all time,0
it was a dandy followup to the earlier quartet and well worth watching,0
the acting was bad but i 've seen worse,0
i for one am also happy that ghost stories are making a comeback and i would much sooner jump in my chair a few times than cringe or hide my eyes or be disgusted by the graphic slasher films also doing the rounds,0
3 out of 10 pretty low in the pecking order of 80 's haunted house movies,0
for over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother if prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself,0
he soon goes off to fight in the napoleonic wars for 10 years and when he returns he sees a radiant woman who he thinks ca n't be hepburn because she seems so young,0
little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states,0
maybe it 's joel silver 's influence and clout but frankly i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching,0
it 's one of martino 's best films,0
i loved every minute of it and i could n't stop laughing,0
it is a series of inside jokes but we the american audiences are stuck on the outside,0
it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership,0
go to cornwall if you do n't believe me,0
but just do n't watch the 3rd,0
nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar look for someone from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get 'what for',0
the characters are as memorable as the story line,0
charles durning is also very good as is lesley ann warren though i just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny,0
aside from a cameo by noah emmerich driving a cab and speaking like a mongoloid the acting is either nonexistent or overdone to the point of inducing nausea,0
some people on this site were comparing this movie to crash,0
it showed that people with bulimia do n't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else,0
the direction by john schlesinger makes the material work,0
dane had noticed the beautiful bohemian maiden and was attracted to her earthy sensual beauty and artistic flare,0
this film is not for all tastes just as conrad 's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes,0
there are a number of reasons for this,0
yes you 're right about the subpar acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc,0
oh and of course the aztec mummy looked really really crappy,0
so lois clark the new adventures of superman receives another full 7 points,0
but make no mistake this is clare danes' movie,0
i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film,0
a corn eating contest is just not funny,0
i saw this movie when it screened in cannes and oh my god,0
this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone,0
the continual parallels between for instance big stupid lenny and candy 's sick old dog which might work in a purely poetic context seem too manufactured for drama,0
believe me i 've seen some bad movies but this one was a real stinker,0
what happened for the rest of frank 's long weekend,0
a universal plot as timeless and as touching as shakespeare 's finest,0
as in summary this is n't a movie at all,0
and the straight captain starts to learn tolerance,0
in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them,0
starsky hutch tv show fans will feel insulted and humiliated by this contemptible makeover of a venerable series,0
i think the ending would have been much better if she actually put up a fight,0
along the way you earn a power called spirit walking you leave your body in a state of meditation while you do what you have to do with your spirit and you shoot with guns that will blow your mind,0
it is therefore difficult to discuss this film on imdb in the same way as most other films,0
the evil brother 's cats,0
it 's crap do n't waste your time on it,0
the bad okay the writing for one is extremely awful,0
he split from his wife irene rich years ago taking cooper and she 'd like to get him back,0
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny,0
the entire small cast of this film is perfection,0
i only hope that the filmmakers really did not expect people to believe this was real footage because they failed miserable,0
he 's left his wife his children have disowned him he 's impotent drinks a lot and contemplates suicide,0
it 's scarier deeper more complex and a far better story,0
it is still one of my dad 's favorite movies and he 's always had a copy,0
the theatrical trailer also in fair shape is offered as an extra,0
take out the violence and this movie belongs next to pete 's dragon on the movie shelf,0
told by a mutual friend about the ultimate drug trip by a certain type of magic mushroom they head to the woods to experience it for themselves,0
it did n't help that i did n't really care for anyone in the film and found myself feeling pity for our antihero because he was in love with someone who seems rather dull,0
it is a powerful experience moving around on her decks,0

then i said to myself i 'll zip past just this part,0
i have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with affleck,0

samantha does n't command much of any language preferring grunts,0
the exception being the last minute or two of the film that really tie it together in a very nice way,0
it 's about a man who has the ability to make things catch fire or something like that,0
this film is perhaps my favorite wayne flick,0
we get a strong sense of who this man was and are only left to wonder why we did n't know more about him already,0
none of the actors are interesting here either,0
the movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing,0
the entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on,0
there is plenty of violence and one particular scene with cherokee jack is particularly gruesome,0
all the rest have been in a billion movies,0

the film is about lucia and the meaning sex has in her life and the life of others,0
i ca n't even say that you are going to see some good karate moves in it,0
this is an early effort of abbott and costello and displays there comedy talents to the fullest,0
the fact is that the film needs to be restored to its widescreen version and released on dvd,0
jokes that play like the first draft of a will and grace episode,0

love lost memories and discoveries are the main emotions that drive this movie,0
the film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic,0
all these camera tricks like the slow motion and weird lighting and lenses and freaky music is what the absence of content looks and sounds like,0

this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia as she lays dying,0

i watched this movie because i'm pretty big michael cera fan and really nothing he 's been in so far has been terrible however this movie looks like it was begging not to be watched,0
but why in heaven 's name portray him in this way,0
it may have had a similar plot what with the whole boy meets girl on vacation girl moves into his school they ca n't be together because of clicks thing,0
the dialogue is suitably cheesy the character 's are just about likable enough in a silly way,0
it 's been over 30 years now but i still remember that this movie was the worst i 've ever seen,0
thirty minutes of my life i 'll never get back,0

molly shannon is always entertaining and leelee sobieski did a great job as a tortured brain,0
holly is working in nakatomi plaza and there is being held a christmas party and under that 12 uninvited guests appears,0
dear me i think i was not very happy when i saw this sequel,0
as usual another masterpiece in the vice academy series,0
i rated it a 710,0
the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force,0
there 's no intensity there 's poor group dynamic there 's no sense of urgency,0
who takes this kind of thing seriously anyway,0
i do n't understand what they were thinking when they made this,0
it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first and then have the player select a dancer instead of shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they 're right,0
the story clearly shows that there is no absolution for seita,0
unfortunately the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist,0

top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy 's died and has given his company to the comedian,0
it seems michael mann is a one hit wonder and simply adding a 10 minute gunfight lifted straight out of heat at the end of the movie is not going to save it,0

cowboy movie actor cameron mitchell turns in an equally strong performance as piano player johnny alderman who leaves etting out of disgust for the way she is being dominated only to encounter her years later when the two of them are working on a movie,0

the only nice thing about the movie was the final scene where we see the meg 's silhouette under the boat,0
his attempts at sexual health tapes were pretty funny,0
on the whole little britain is a great comedy and should be seen by all as a taste of how comedy should be,0

it makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even on a nobrainer action level,0
i could n't believe that his output had gotten so bad so i was researching his stv output on imdb and trying to see which one was the best of the trash pile,0
equally insulting is the 60 's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie or the 80 's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television,0
fans of ray charles will no doubt enjoy the film for the music but it is worth watching even for those who do not know much about him chiefly on account of jamie foxx 's oscarwinning performance in the title role reproducing charles 's mannerisms so exactly that we think we actually are watching a blind man even though foxx himself is sighted,0
a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead so holly is then left on her own,0
job well done to mostly everyone on this production this was a tightly wrought law thriller that was no chip off the old block by any means,0

it 's clearly not the director 's intention to make a crowdpleasing film,0
i know the actress doyeon jeon got the cannes award for best actress for this movie,0
it now around 700 in the morning again,0
the sets and special effects are all well done never detracting form the believability of the story although the kilrathi themselves are rather under developed and one dimensional,0
some adults may not enjoy this film but kids will perhaps even teenagers,0
especially notable is the always entertaining clarence muse appearing as a club car porter who does the almost impossible by stealing a scene from rathbone,0
from the police response to the bitter end it was really bad,0
however the movie is easy enough to follow that people who do n't like complex horror films can sit back and enjoy the ride,0
i'm glad to see such an exciting innovative and yet accessible television series produced here in canada,0
and through this entire movie these people were getting into situations that they could have easily called the police on,0
though set in the sparse almost barren confines of black mesa arizona the film comes to life with sparkling and intelligent dialog that underscores it 's mission to give meaning to the lives of it 's two protagonists allan squier and gabrielle gabby maple,0
most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson,0
believe me that there are thousands of better films out there from the 1930s waiting to be discovered,0
sure there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good girl running from the mob etc but these people are really out there and i relate to each and every one of them,0
the special effects were terrible,0
shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual comingofage story the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting,0
this is the 21st century,0
jacko himself was pretty sweet,0
the only thing this movie has going for itself is stallone 's cool beard some nice chicks and some cool music,0

one of the key discussions was about how far a movie could go,0
this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius,0
i 've never liked haunted house films even the shining failed to impress me which is seen as one of the best horror films of all time by most people,0
this was the beginning of monkey island,0
and such pearl it is,0
lets not even go there,0
hopeless is the best way to describe this timewaster directed by william lustig,0
i remember it being good but damn,0
though it started out with great intentions featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes,0
and as an adult viewer i have to admit that it 's pretty goofy and unconvincing in that you have to believe some fairly silly improbable things to get even a slight tingle up the spine from it,0
hell this unbeatable outing even possesses a commendably daring and provocative subtext the flagrant abuse and mistreatment of power and authority with especially revealing insights on role playing and how men use sex as a means to an end for totally controlling and dominating over women,0
the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done,0
five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team,0
after these two get torn to pieces the villagers and the count go looking for the wolves that supposedly did this grisly deed,0
they bed down at a dilapidated mansion which is owned by eric 's father and was the scene of a recent unsolved murder,0
it 's just a cheesy dumb flick nothing more nothing less,0
admittedly i use this sort of gear all the time and do tend to notice minor details like whether or not i can actually turn it on or not but this crack team of experts seemed to miss that,0
lets face it the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment vern but more funny to see vern get back at ernest for bothering him in the first place,0
thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 otherwise we would have missed out on this gem,0
not that i think it should have ever been banned it is just that shorts that were less disturbing and more worth watching this were banned and because of this are not very well known nowadays,0
many people will agree that for a movie the original sequel and the 3rd one is enough,0
it made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous i had to laugh,0
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history,0
to american film makers there is more than 1 country in the uk,0
so what happened in alive,0
the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light,0
what was the purpose of the black gloves,0
this film was broadcast in it 's entirety in 1988 i taped it off tv and still have the vhs copy,0
it also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate,0
we are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like 1974 's texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature,0
lom plays the dual role of the twin brothers and this in itself is cleverly handled,0
i so much enjoyed this little musical fantasy i bought a copy to share with my friends,0
i was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it,0
tho shot in black and white the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes,0
so far we 've stayed pretty true to the source material,0
unfortunately science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons,0
why would they need it,0
i was also held in disbelieve by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed,0
miike apparently has some thing for mother 's milk too if you 've seen gozu then you know what i mean,0
i did n't expect much from this movie it was just one of those movies i thought i 'd just watch because it was on television,0
i was at the first show eagerly awaiting a new film by the director of juon,0
trust the man is a director and a scriptwriter looking for a reason to justify this shallow ill conceived and ultimately boring movie,0
no reason to watch even wonder,0
it was done by a bunch of pros well i might add,0
it was very implausible and unrealistic,0
this is n't a parody of enter the dragon the main character is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size,0
what a mistake that was,0
ivan the red keeps discarding these ninja 's until he gets to fight gordon then he will try and kill billy gordon gets ready to face ivan the red and stop him from becoming the ultimate ninja warrior,0
i had n't seen this film in 35 years but it was still the comic gem i remembered,0
f murray abraham is not in this version unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits,0
well even losers that actually like national lampoon shall hate this movie they 'll want to murder the director i swear to god,0
it seems like everyone on this message board missed a very important point about satyricon it is based on a book,0
the movie is not a typical clich indian movie so dun expect to see songs or romance or melodrama,0
just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money,0
linda blair was the best actress here,0
even the frozen shock ending is totally torn from the loo,0
the relationship between ron moody and david soul was about two losers one of which lost a dog who turned up at the local pound and needed to use the other guy to get him out of the pound by working as a double act and begging for money in local bars,0
however i am not one of them,0
but such ingenuity deserves a better script,0
a film to make you wish you had made it yourself,0

just like in a video game,0
most of the lines were contrived,0
and so they shattered the fourth wall at the end by having the king and his nobles sing about the battle with the ogre and praise the efforts of puss in boots when they by rights should n't have even known about it,0
in part this is because she is not allocated enough time to do anything more than superficially convey either side of the character,0
all things considered phantasm iii is an acceptable timewaster but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors,0
the cousins about to get yes evicted from their premises decide to throw a party,0
see the brute man and you will beware the murderous psychopath who disarms his victims by preying on feelings of sympathy,0
the first time i saw the poster i was stunned by its tranquility and beauty,0
if the intention was to create a perpetual circle it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort,0
this is a very bad movie because muslims should stay with muslims,0
this film is a travesty,0
either way this is pretty much the purgatory between boring french professionalism and the heavenly campy joe d'amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot,0
the second story cut also straightforward might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra his wife attached to a piano like a puppet and a child strapped against a sofa,0
and as already mentioned the narration is monotone,0
so i found myself wishing there had been both more and less dialogue at the same time,0
we all have a mountain of swords within us,0
not to forget the great cast of these three unlike friends and the girl of course,0
perhaps it is the blackandwhite photography that lends it some atmosphere,0
other than that there 's nothing here that 's worth your time,0
bill shirley is the young lovestruck foster whose kindness to slaves includes giving the money saved for an engagement ring to pay the hospital cost for an injured little black boy,0
so if one want to modernize the plot heshe should construct a story where the dukes and the legendary general lee surpass oppressive forces of today leaving that humane feeling to the audience they always did,0
film is supposed to be visual in nature and this has people sitting around talking the whole time,0
some of them keep showing up as if they will have something important to add to a climactic scene,0
when it was over i probably would n't be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the chupacabra looked like for whenever it was in a scene the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monster 's face clearly,0
however one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just ca n't relate to very well are these horror films,0
even an appearance by dennis hopper in full easy rider swing could n't save it,0
this movie was n't full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them,0
this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon,0
it 's september of 2004 and i keep hoping deep sigh,0
either way i sincerely did not like the movie,0
then movie goes on they are spectacular car races in rome,0
and at just an hour long it still had 15 minutes of padding,0
the film was duly submitted and passed,0
the characters are dull and the actors are n't good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark,0
so maybe it is a question of fashion,0
this was the composer 's first onstage appearance in twelve years the hall was packed,0
another thing i like about the show is the quality of the camera work,0
hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion 's head gaping at the slammed door,0
but i keep on trying i always will,0
and it really really blows,0
cute in an odd way but never beautiful,0
the puppets role is once again down played so with bad human acting it kills the movie,0
he explained that since it was a free screening he could n't give us anything in return no matter how much agony we were suffering through,0
so i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on,0
clive owen plays the role straight with a real gift for humor as well as action,0
real good role model for young black men,0
okay so it starts very unimaginatively with a narration from the lead character but it goes on to become something miraculous,0
still of the night is indeed a very silent and dark movie,0
nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated,0
that sounds like the opening scene of a softcore porn film and at first it seems that that is exactly what donkey punch is turning into,0
i would find this a little funny but it 's her clich puns that ruin it,0
there is very little dialogs but that just make it seem more real,0
actually why have i wasted my time writing about it ah dam,0
second i 'd like to hear more about the mask and its symbolic,0
reminds me of the dukes of hazard how the duke boys were always getting into one fix or another over and over and the whole time they were living in a tiny rural county,0
she has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere all they really want is to borrow money from her,0
beverly d'angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upperclass teenager,0
loni anderson 's hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray did n't go out in the sixties,0
the following day the two detectives visit andrews but he is unhelpful and evasive and seems to be hiding something,0
i would have loved to have been at the red carpet black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath it is on the dime dvd racks now look for it for entertainment value this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up,0
other twilight zone episodes about time travel such as no time like the past once upon a time etc,0
towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed,0
secondly being from melbourne it was all very real,0
in no way did i feel that the movie showed any type of a growing relationship that would justify anyone giving up the degree of control that was displayed,0
i knew ax was n't a healthy man but if he was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card,0
the first vampires was fun but this low budget retread makes me yawn,0
the set in no way looks like vietnam and this dude in no way looks like a soldier,0
above this i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this illustrated throughout the movie by sidney 's attitude do n't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else even saints were people in the beginning as sophie once says in the movie,0
the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick,0
as in my god imagine the tragedy that could happen,0
this was the tarzan that was of the novel and the film makers should be applauded for tackling the source material and taking it seriously,0
kinski mullan and jovovich did a decent job of acting,0
nevertheless not ten minutes into the film i along with the others i was with had successfully predicted the antagonist,0
if you figure out what that 's about let me know,0
it is occasionally funny and does poke fun at the horror genre but it is pretty bad,0
it holds up until the brightly lit ending which looks like something the studio had filmed to appease the censors,0
cheap looking and worst of all boring action scenes,0
it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing,0
he builds unbearable tension throughout the story and scares to such a degree that sometimes we cannot watch,0
all in all you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time but i would n't suggest seeing this movie unless you 've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing,0
so many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so heartbreakingly true,0
i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr rooney in it will never leave me,0
it also contains some quite funny bits,0
why did n't anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening,0
not in comparison to the others but simply on it 's own merit or lack of,0
if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one,0
there 's better porn on the internet,0
whereas the tv special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the grinch,0
that 's the same schtick as the unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism gag in austin powers except it was a joke in austin powers,0
take it from me and where i came from,0
ann marie sees a couple who she thinks would make great parents for her,0
the kicker here is that despite being a low budget film it does n't play like one,0
i am in love with his eyes and well everything he does is superior to most british actors today,0
they were in the movie for five seconds then you never heard from them again,0
he makes every other kid show look like award winners,0
the parts where rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests looking down at them through his nose,0
we get a sheriff who 's the father of wanted criminal hamlet,0
i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market,0
it is refreshing to see a mature beatty display so much creativity and energy in one film,0
above all else this film seeks to confound confront,0
it 's one film you have to watch and it really should be in the top 250 on imdb,0
so the sheriff has his gun pointed at mm who is and i give the movie and rick baker props for this the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form that we have ever seen,0
in a society where it 's more important to show a perfect facade to society than to deal with your emotional problems it 's probably no wonder that sigmund freud founded the psychoanalysis in vienna,0
i guess that it would have been even worse if it was n't for julio,0
a pitiful subject for a horror movie,0
the original was no classic but it was bad enough to be enjoyable had beautiful photography and plenty of sex and nudity,0
naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing,0
boys 2 men however named their hit record after this film,0
i'm not going to have that boy take a rap bradford vows to bardoni for a murder he did n't commit,0
watching arnold cry is seeing acting so bad that it is laughable,0
instead it choices a straight forward approach,0
i could n't imagine the gary cooper character in high noon getting any help from the two male leads in this film,0
it 's a quite intriguing dramatic story with also romance present in it,0
in fact it is less scary than entering a haunted mansion at an amusement park,0
after his shoes break in the last game of the year he quits after the game even though the team made the playoffs,0
i'm sure he knew the networks were having a cow,0
i should have known in the final fight scene that it was the main bad guy who was killed that was the most realistic makeup of the entire move,0
it turned out he was a fully capable performer in negative roles,0
the acting is not amazing the film is not beautiful in any sense,0
these zombies do n't just run they jump shoot weapons and somehow manage to crawl on walls and ceilings,0
there 's a bizarre scene featuring a highly strung police captain played by comedian tom green the whole subplot about the two cops is totally forgotten about they disappear before the film finishes,0
the characters are wonderful the situations are delicious and the possibilities are intriguing,0
though it was like the play it was not as complicated,0
he 's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero and has the type of strong solid presence that wallace beery did half a century before him,0
first of all i 've got to give it to the people that got this thing together,0
i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but i'm not entirely sure i 've discovered all the nuances yet,0
but i still had to sit through several scenes of dismemberment and pain which made me sick,0
kane had cost undertaker the wwe championship at the royal rumble and then killed him when he helped shawn michaels lock undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before,0
adrien brody brings about a lot of sensitivity to the role being the timid of the brothers yearning to live a richer more fulfilling life than one which is based on deceit and always a puppet of his brother 's script manipulated to such an extent that calls for betrayal of trust and an incident from childhood that forever haunts his memory,0
it was this show that started on the independent film channel but got turned into a full blown sitcom on fox,0
this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see,0
citizen kane it sure is n't but if you 've had a bad day and are in the mood for crashing out in front of something not too intellectually stimulating then i tentatively suggest this might just be your thing,0
i'm giving this 2 stars since it is so bad that it bounced off the bottom of the scale and began heading towards the entertaining end of the spectrum again,0
i 've read precious bane and gone to earth which are my favorites by mary webb many times and have collected other novels by her also,0
much like the aforementioned movie i came across it when different friends of mine attempted to discard a movie that they said they could not stand through the opening credits,0
this is a woman who men are drawn to,0
i really think though that he deserved better than this pale wraith of a flick,0
it is apparent here that the dad is n't a ghost like his children,0
as lindy rushes to the tent a dingo dog is just exiting shaking his head,0
parts are a bit weak but overall this is a very strong film,0
it flows and has credibility throughout and could be compared to the sting,0
the character of morgan pym it 's one of my favorite characters ever close to solid snake because he 's tough but out of clichs the guy also have feelings inside which is actually good,0
i graduated from high school the year the movie was made so maybe i can relate to it better,0
the jokes are lame and predictable,0
whether or not this is true will soon be put to debate as the murder begins a chain of events which finally bring meaning to many people 's lives as they wake up to the tangential fragility of life,0
the ending is trite and hokey,0
an exception are big bears which are so fearless that they 're merely enraged by mortal wounds,0
sorry to repeat myself over and over but here 's another great columbo episode,0
new characters are introduced and old ones face new unexpected challenges,0
the laughs are there but given how they 're executed and placed it is clear they are gags that have been worked into the film to help make it funnier,0
one of the best parts of this crime drama is the absolute lack of liberal political spin about how society supposedly mistreats criminals the typical spin of 1970 thru 1980 false stupid and silly such pictures justified crime and contributed to its increase,0
third viewing rewatch without the commentary,0
on the other side we see women past girlfriends fellow artists and others who admit that crumb is a great illustrator but are extremely wary of the sexist and racist messages crumb 's comics contain,0
i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits,0
we know how things work and realize there could be no justice or mercy for ulises,0
the film was mostly shot in new york like the naked city and its cast is sprinkled liberally with a lot of familiar names and faces,0
he and ashley were better suited than berg and ashley,0
if you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters are excellent choices to begin with,0
it 's too bad andre de toth did n't contribute more to the noir cycle because on the evidence he was a natural,0
it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time,0
there is one part where our heroine wakes up after being rendered unconscious to find the situation has changed in a way that does n't make in sense in terms of plot logic or pacing,0
al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene,0
they make him a nice breakfast but george is n't hungry,0
instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic,0
instead it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world,0
it 's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of quentin tarantino,0
i was blessed to have seen this movie last night,0
the whole concept of an architect of some buildings being responsible for how the people there act later was also very weak,0
watch the body language between him and the hot blond,0
rounding out the cast is linda watkins as the obnoxious mrs kilgore the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake cockney accent,0
one of the first things i noticed was during winston 's day to day life in his work his conversations eating in the cafeteria etc,0
and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money,0
they bring adorable charm to their roles,0
he 's hilarious when he 's crying,0

when the wagon train is attacked by indians lucas arrives to serve as its military escort,0

when they recorded the movie i was just a baby because i'm born in 1988 in addition i wanna say that was a very cool movie and i liked it a lot and a big thanks to robbin williams with his excellent play,0
steve cochran 's an excon who 's never been with a woman,0
disney you 're based out of california florida right amidst the rest of the states that still treat us like a foreign country,0
it 's an interesting human story but not at all compelling and there is hardly any ending,0
i ca n't exactly pinpoint the moment but soon the movie gets a lot better,0
as if dodgy leads were n't bad enough a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run,0
now we 're suppose to empathize with that ahole,0
what is a white squall anyway,0
you do n't have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh 's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues,0
mind fearnet only lists this movie as dark floors not by it 's full name,0
i wanted to know what they did after the game,0
there is plenty of voice overs in this film and this fing annoying voice is going at it,0
i did like the flashbacks,0
without the twin story of the american woman people would undoubtedly walk away from this feel feeling a lot differently,0
there are n't that many bigfoot nessie etc flicks out there so you guys might like this,0
it 's a steaming pile of frightmare,0
you just sit there staring at the screen losing your brain cells and wondering how on earth someone got money to produce this pile of garbage,0
what was this movie actually about,0
but when the lady feels it 's time to make her will she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler,0
then again this film is set during one of the bloodiest chapters of american history and demands unflinching depiction accordingly,0
the sequel does a great job of avoiding the urge to fix what 's unbroken but instead to polish it,0
he takes a rich compelling screen archetype and turns it into a corny joke,0
thats one big mistake that costs the film dearly,0
it is more painful to watch than a dog bite,0
the macho soccer coach broke me up too,0
the story follows the off screen set up of a high school girl suicide and goes on to explore the antics of various teenagers none of whom seem to feel any remorse for the dead teen who one describes as 'a nice girl but no angel',0
i really do n't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this,0
this movie is pure of heart,0
i rented this movie and was very disappointed in it,0
however i was quite looking forward to watching this film but now wish i had n't bothered,0
why did n't adam simply just run hector 's batteries down and overload him again,0
i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar unnecessary and above all stupid some of the scenes were,0
her kids think it 's cool and her husband is duly worried kathleen turner takes the lead role and does an excellent job of performing in a serious yet jokey way which does the film no end of favours on the parody front,0
this oscarworthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another,0
why did they make him a fighter pilot,0
he seems angry at everyone and everything with only a handful of compassionate moments reserved for those who ca n't do him any harm,0
this movie was the worst i 've ever seen,0
dreyer is murdered before he can spill any beans but leaves a photo in a bank deposit box a more recent picture of alicia,0
i do n't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long or longer to do it right and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public it would n't fly,0
and douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years,0
despite the wit to some of the ideas its absolutely boring,0
this movie is so utterly terrible i can barely bring myself to comment on it,0
movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises,0
do n't remember which part either,0
not that it is n't an uphill battle,0

all we have is this circumstance that just took placed,0

sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind she tells her husband,0
dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine 's death and the cover up,0

i 'll sum it up though it happens so trinity can get back into the matrix to setup the end,0
i would estimate that i 've seen over a thousand movies in my lifetime,0
look at a film from 1969 then look at one from 1974 flowery chintzy all greasy and horrible,0
yes you heard me the 60s,0
either way it 's an unforgettable experience,0
although this film was clearly a bad idea from the beginning the first half actually is n't too bad,0
i love dissing this movie,0
i had to resist the urge to talk like a stranger after seeing the movie a few times,0
i just do n't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story,0
caesar had mel brooks working as a writer on his show,0
you can really say he is the anchor of the base,0
karloff was famous for his portrayal of horrific monsters mummies sensationalist creations not at all in tune with the psychological thrillers for which lewton was noted with very low budgets he was able to fashion fascinating films in which the atmosphere was every bit as important as the plot,0
i love this movie but it is so scary,0
the other brides on board are also strange when throwing themselves into the arms of the buyers,0
i just saw this on turner classic movies and from now on norma shearer is the face i will put on marie antoinette,0
this film should have stuck to being entertaining,0
based on the previews it looked like it was going to be highly amusing,0
it 's a man who dies and his spirit runs through the scenarios that could of prevented his death but his ego spared relevant memories to realize the consequences of escaping his own death leads the ego to act in order of what actually happened and this could be said to be in spite of the true nature of his spirit leaving the spirit to accept that death is the order the ego would take over living since living with the consequences of escaping death would not satisfy the ego,0
the rest of the cast was forgettable there are several pointless scenes and what 's more the film tries to focus on sex,0
it was batista that picked up the popular victory in the main event battle but not without controversy or should i say a botched finish,0
we can see them also gradually losing hope that they 'll be able to properly sort the events out and reveal the truth,0
valentino by the way is one of her suitors,0
it will take you completely out of your everyday life and deposit you in the world of the romans,0
unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing,0
futurama is one of my all time favorite shows,0
david starts demonstrating a trick guillotine to falk and shows how to make it seem to pass through an object without destroying the object,0
the core of battlestar galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire,0

it was considered funny then,0
truly i wish this were the whole movie it is that good,0
this show was no small part of a successful cbs group in the 1980 's,0
the date for that is in september but its probably gonna get pushed back,0
it is at this point that dr jarvis the man from the adopting agency arrives,0
let me start off by saying i was forced to give this movie a positive score and my actual rating is 28 if you enjoy being bored to sleep or feeling sick to your stomach this is your kind of movie,0
it 's not a terrible film,0
the movie also suffers from the age old it 's creepy because it 's almost perfect,0
the prof was dedicated to his school and the boys in that school,0
i just rented this film,0
the plotline goes like this when a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive,0
not so much because of what happens but because of why it happens,0
i 've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now,0
the mobster fixes the match by kidnapping the official and substituting fake officials who make blatantly unfair calls,0
seven out of ten stars,0
when the main character played by bland colin hanks son of tom finally arrives at the college of his dreams within ten minutes he 's accidentally given the dean of admissions enough x to blind a horse and to top it off his zany druggedout brother burns the admissions building to the ground,0
the special effects were secondrate at best with obvious seams visible and cgi clearly recognizable,0
i ca n't believe this film had two costume designers in the credits since there are only three items one bra one pair of panties and one pair of men 's underwear in the entire film,0
or that the cops did n't even have close to real uniforms,0
i think it 's time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him,0
perhaps if those who thought up such a movie sought to make one that mocked people who really were out to find a real nessie now that could have had some potential,0
not the worst film i 've ever seen on mst3k but down there in the bottom ranks definitely,0
i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic freethinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father,0
all that 's really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil,0
that 's what people mean when they say a narrative is fast,0
i was expecting the worst when i started watching this,0
although closeup shots of faces in angst were designed to make the watcher feel the excitement brewing among the contestants we did n't ever get a chance to know them or for that matter care much about them,0
most disturbing to me is the fact that people not only enjoyed this movie they loved it,0
hmmm i really do n't know what to say about it except how great it was so i'm gonna stop typing,0
although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it,0
second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable,0
that being said most people wo n't notice,0
my nomination for this year 's razzie,0
would love to see many many more films of this quality,0
those who hate it have failed to understand something very important that it is set in the land of dreams,0
in result we have a film with no climax and not capable to create in us any root of interest for the people involved,0
and if you like this you 'll love serial mom,0
there was nothing about this movie that i liked,0
having done some research on the making of the film i have to hand it to those guys the filmmakers actors writers etc for having put together such a film with such limited resources,0
a dinosaur against an obvious green screen is n't much fun and little green reptilian men in obvious costumes and masks that barely move other than to open and close their mouths are hard to take seriously,0
seymour 's conversation with morgan morgan in the diner for example is wonderfully funny and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film,0
the original was a makeup effects landmark,0
money makes the world go around is a perfect musical number and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of germany at the time,0
soha looks so sweet in the movie,0
nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationship,0
still it 's men like this who risked and often gave their lives on the fields of europe and africa and in the waters and islands of the pacific that we have to thank for the freedoms we enjoy in the united states today,0
710 many differently edited and rated versions exist,0
i'm aware i 've gone on a bit of a tangent here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel but the truth is it was n't even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust,0
the only other small problem i had was that sometimes they take too long to do things but no where near as long as some shows like prison break,0
i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here 's what i mean,0
this deserving film definitely should be added to everyone 's mustsee list,0
overall a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time,0
it is most certainly not one of the best movies i have seen but as the angst ridden road movie it is it is highly watchable,0
so pseudo serious and sexually free,0
by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared,0
from all of this the aspect that truly makes this series wonderful is the quiet desperation,0
sure what i saw directly on screen was a small cast a plot and a vague resolution but like 911 the point was that reality was so much larger and more complex,0
the finger device is confusing and adds nothing to the story nor does the decision to divide the narrative into arbitrary chapters,0
finally the second sequel it totally disappointed me,0
she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her,0
at least it was restricted to a digital channel so the majority of people would have avoided watching it,0
it was a cute idea but it was n't done right,0
i saw this movie a few years back on tv and thought it was really funny,0
director james cameron scored against all odds a huge success with titanic,0
is good enough to judge it on itself,0
the script is straight from the pioneering 1953 tv series when spying on earth from a satellite was a futuristic idea and travelling in a spacecraft 500000 miles from earth was a step into the unknown,0
but beyond the amusing laughs of alan funt 's situations lies a surprising glimpse into the uncensored attitudes of american culture in the midst of social upheaval,0
the movie is obviously not for all tastes but it should be said that the sex is never gratuitous,0
however aside from all this it really is a great anime and in my opinion is a true masterpiece in both story and horror,0
anything would be better than sitting through this waste of resources,0
nevertheless chaplin created some of the most uproarious scenes in movie history combining his ingenious slapstick with a genuine humanity that made his character feel like more than just an object of humiliation,0

for those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before,0
on the other side of the spectrum is peter a lowlife hitman the biggest flaw is the film 's trying to make the movie adaptation cohesive when the book was anything but,0
a lot of the movie 's humor is generated by the fact that ted and alice while young and trying to be with it are really at heart a little uptight,0

it was a leslie nielsen moment not an albert brooks moment,0

i doubt i 've seen such a bad film with such good credits in a long time,0
charming i thought he might be,0
it 's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out,0
i was so disappointed by this show,0

get to that film to discover the hundreds of details and risks outoftowners run in new york city an apple in which any smiling friendly face may be the worm that is eating the core of it,0
and that one is n't even that great either,0
i will however say that the most interesting twist is the whole ex gay ministry segment with their homo no more movement lead by allen who obviously gets off on the other ex gays telling of their sexual slip ups with men,0
and it 's truly the only good sequence in the movie,0
i did n't want to be disappointed,0
so if you were n't around during that period see this movie,0
i would remake it and make this control system better so jaws is not so damn hard to control,0
unlike many i do n't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive,0
so he rarely is able to stay to the end of a rehearsal for a commercial,0
the poor man must have got the script only after signing the contract,0

they act together as well as olivia and john travolta do,0
the vignette ends with a far away view of scrooge and the ghost triumphantly silhouetted atop a hill as the carol reaches its ending crescendo,0
this was a show that seemed as if it was well thought out the writing scored huge points in my book,0
i am not saying that the show was in any way not appropriate for family viewing but if you check the other works from the shows producer you will find more adult themes in his works which are also excellent,0
i wonder if this film would ever have been made if they had not been related to jacqueline bouvier kennedy,0

so does the prodigal son return,0
how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film,0
it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayal a must see,0

i 'd much rather watch any of hitchcock 's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more,0
beyond being a bad terribly dull movie i have a bigger problem with jungle goddess racism,0
some of the problems with this movie is that its plot went here and there and the movie had a very uneven flow to it that and it seemed to shift genres a bit much too,0
what i mean by that is that the ideas that come to mind from having read the premise of the film are probably about as funny as the film itself,0
he can dance but cannot act,0
different strokes for different folks,0
cary grant is every bit dunne 's match as the befuddled husband who finds himself with one wife too many,0

but is pete really innocent,0
the ending does come rather abruptly,0
granted piper perabo others do an okay job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter,0
incestuous sub plots and maniacal old ladies do n't upset anyone anymore nowadays so lake dead is actually rather soft by today 's standards,0
meanwhile ed and dexter must rescue otis the world 's oldest fast food employee from the demented hills asylum and ed might just find love with monique if he could take his mind off the burgers long enough to pay attention to her,0
it lacks any originality or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one,0
it feels like they had a tight schedule and only took one shot at every scene even if it turned out to be a bad one,0
not a bad and somewhat beautiful song,0
now that is laugh out loud funny,0
even their parents watch it now,0
this film was a great surprise for me its proposal is to show and discuss the prejudice of the society against homosexuals and it is very well presented,0
he has a sister that much like joaquin phoenix in signs hangs around and tries to help out,0
glad i did it was a very entertaining film with many genuine laughs,0
there had been some mildly amusing humour but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time,0
i was amused but slightly disappointed,0
this one from korea is better than any recent movies of the genre from japan forget hollywood,0
she believes that praying to saint anne will solve all her and her friends troubles,0
getting dragged by a truck and head crushed is pretty nifty,0

if it was a mediocre movie it deserves a mediocre comment,0
alive combines the tension of vincenzo natali 's cube with kitamura 's own versus,0
it is this bubble that also has the potential to lull one 's mind into a false sense of reality,0
if you 'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it,0
pretty good deal for them pretty raw deal for the viewer,0
technically glenville 4 it does n't really require the viewer to have seen the others except maybe part 3 but even part 3 opens with an epilogue from part 2 oh never mind,0
then there 's the bit where the dirt pushes one house over by 90 degrees but the couple inside are holding onto their furniture for dear life,0
i realize that those on the fringe seeking change are not very popular and thus wo n't have millions to make a glossy movie,0
shot in high contrast black and white panic in the streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in new orleans,0
i do n't know if seagal is continuing to make eastern movies now but this was all the better for it,0
you can do a lot with a little cash,0
some critics talk about it as if it is a kurosawa movie,0
mora is in no rush to reveal anything and allows the mood created by strieber 's dilemma to play out slowly,0
darkness was all around vicki etc etc and so on and so on for an hour,0
one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of,0
such songs as you 're devastating and the touch of your hand got relegated however to just part of the instrumental background,0
please advise on current status of this good film,0
the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects,0
jane brings out the humanity in him and he brings out the untamed side of her,0
if mummy raider was presented as a youtube video i 'd rate it higher but as a film destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than 12 a out of 4,0
the man is not convincingly freezing by the way,0
there were so many scenes in the movie that made me feel physically ashamed for everybody involved in this production that i still feel a bit dizzy,0
i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations,0
he also looks quite different by the way without his trademark small mustache in this movie,0
for some reason the girl hawke likes has some sort of psychic link to the guys and looks on as they walk away from their doomed spaceship,0
unless you consider the trailer and director comments to be special,0
a tshirt with strips of black leather on it,0
spoiler end i just love russel crowe after i watched gladiator,0
it does n't need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing,0
all the girls in this film are suppose to be under 18 which if i remember correctly two of them are 17 and one is 16 now in the usa even though underage sex occurs on a daily basis many production or finance companies wo n't finance a film like this because of the sexual content,0
the r rating the nudity would have provided would have actually been a public service because it would have kept impressionable children from watching this mess,0
the one redeeming factor is in the visual effects area,0
there are some brief homages to noir as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind but there 's really nothing here to recommend it the performances are awful ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine,0
this sequel focus mostly on bambi and the relationship with his father something clearly missing on the original,0
but it still has left one strong lingering impression,0
let me make it clear that i did n't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have,0
this is a wonderful film and one can tell that it 's definitely a labor of love,0
this leads our heroes to escape only to land in the arms of two insane killers that are in the process of torturing some people in a deli in a small town,0
i'm sitting in my office,0
it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life,0
there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men women and children in the burning compound,0
the greatest compliments to the other commentator here at imdb who asked himself why this series did n't get stuck in its time to last a lot longer like many other series in the 80s did,0
it had no story yet the actors were ok they used cheap tricks to scare us some were unwillingly funny as the computer graphics were plainly horrible,0
then things should turn around within the next day or so,0
once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull but come on three times,0
the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa,0
as you can plainly see none of these complaints have any relevance to the information contained,0
how the hell can he help her in any way shape or form,0
a sparkling film with a great cast and everything working,0
it ai n't progressive to be sure but it 's sorta charming in its own right,0
some entertaining despite obvious flaws night of the bloody apes,0
soon after this show i bought the dvd version which has about 20 minutes of deleted scenes all of which are hilarious,0
the screenplay was more sitcom material than movie material where the comedic lines just do n't sound natural at all,0
i wanted to leave after 15 minutes due to panic attacks and nausea,0
this is a beautiful picture to watch,0
jack frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight,0
i have mixed reactions to this movie,0
she then teases him like any woman can,0
not for spectacular cinematography explosions or effects but because this is one of a rare breed of movie that captures life real life in such a way that you are there,0
movie he uses hypnosis on various servants,0
the same can be said of kyle maclachlan 's claudius,0
it is one of the few animated movies that you really just fall in love with,0
there are no sex scenes no nudity swearing violence are kept to a minimal level there is no gore,0
though the opening sequences hint a sort of 80s madefortv movie quality which this movie might 've done better as,0
the blue red and white title captain america unceremoniously appears on the screen but we 're in 1936 italy,0
yeah maybe he was there the last 6 times,0
the acting is wooden stiff and heartless,0
i get the feeling that mamoulian did n't really like the score and tried his best to submerge it,0
yet for one reason i ca n't,0
all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind but there was something very human about all of them that i could n't help but be drawn to and really feel for them particularly chen 's girlfriend,0
i ca n't separate what i did n't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it,0
then please do not watch this movie just go a bury your heads in the sand and tap together your little red shoes 'there 's no place like home',0
there 's no such thing as a minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they 're as well deserved as best picture or best director,0
it plods on and on trying to funny in some spots and failing miserably,0
not even an interesting failure,0
i wonder if he 's related to philip the director,0
so after watching 1 hour of the movie i found out that it would be more fun to eat my own at least i would n't have such an awful aftertaste in my mouth as i had when watching this movie,0
yes some people find it stupid,0
the movie requires just as much from the audience as it gives them,0
guaranteed to make you laugh whether or not you normally like gangster type movies,0
it creates a feeling of unease and constantly keeps the viewer on edge,0
if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage,0
the toll gate an excellent movie by any standard and hart was a very fine actor not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion in the days before sound,0
the concept is good but it is trapped in the bad directing acting dialogue and cheesiness of the film,0
even the writing and presentation of many of the scenes intended to move the film 's audiences are incredibly juvenile something an adolescent might take seriously beyond an idle daydream,0
please if you ever hear of a movie like this ever being made again take a bat and start beating in the head of the director,0
wonderfully atmospheric film with a unique sense of place and welldrawn characters,0
it is a morality play,0
scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall,0
the production values are not too great and the score is awful,0
the movie concentrated on the conflicts that lead almost to the destruction of their marriage,0
wolfman jack plays himself when he plays a very special request going out from richard dreyfuss to his dream girl suzanne sommers,0
even worse than jaws the revenge,0
i also liked the acting guillaume depardieu is not playing pierre,0
who knows if there 's a god,0
maybe if a professional editor had put it together for biography i would have felt more satisfied,0
the stories are simple and very easy to understand and teach us all valuable lessons on the road to life about being helpful and kind to your neighbours,0
depends on who you ask,0
this movie is a hardtofind gem,0
what are we left with in western civilization,0
we look forward to future films by laurent firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected,0
even though history paints him as inept and weak the movie gives a heart to this unfortunate man that evokes compassion and understanding,0
the argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one,0
how wrong could they have been this year,0
and since the only movie we 'd not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for that,0
he seems to do what he can with eric roth 's adaptation of fitzgerald 's short story i just felt it needed more detail and more happenings,0
no passion emotion nothing is there,0
it gives no interpretation of these episodes but leaves them for the viewer to ponder along with the paintings of ohwon himself,0
the dialogue is nearly as unspeakable as the horrors offered up in hell the lighting goes from too bright to pitch and there 's absolutely no one to cheer for,0
their relationship reminds me a lot of that between martin sheen and sissy spacek in badlands where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger,0
this is n't the type of story that you can pick and choose what works it must fit together,0
the acting could have been better the background was okay but it was a little hokey and could have used more explanation,0
this movie full of stupid humour that leave you confuse and will make you laughing how stupid the movie is,0
but nobody expected that the japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles ha ha do n't worry,0
it was a boxoffice hit so of course you knew what was coming scary movie 4 with all the core regulars back in action makes fun of war of the worlds the grudge the village saw and saw ii million dollar baby and brokeback mountain,0
do n't be alarmed maybe he wants you to look at the film he made about how his house was to be built,0
and you can count on one hand the amount of slapstick gags,0
you genuinely become interested in what 's going on and patiently await the resolution to explain the weird events that are taking place,0
i reiterate this is the worst animated feature of any description that i have ever seen,0
so when being able to see an italian movie or should i call it a miniseries that deals with all these aspects of italian life i knew i had to watch it,0
next thing i knew i was fastforwarding past another part that had just become tiresome then another then another and i had to make myself stop,0
this is n't your average oddity that you find on the internet have a couple seconds of amusement and then forget about,0
but the camera and the script love these irish rogues a little too much,0
i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it 's the first road picture i 've seen,0
instead we got the violence and hopelessness that is thelma louise,0
i'm not saying a lady 's man ca n't be struck dumb now and again but we 've got to have some since of why that would be the case,0
thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it 's time,0
there was another parallel with the dead women in the bathtub in both movies and the father getting crazy and going after an authority figure with an axe,0
it 's always good to remember that david hasselhoff is a god,0
i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazoncom based on my other interests,0
if the writer knew what they were doing this film would have followed the proven formula and made hartnett an ass and leelee as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship from which she 's saved by klein,0
well worth a watch for those with the stomach,0
that 's because it sets up the sequel featuring reggie and jack like i said contrived,0
the tone is all over the place,0
for a crime show to be funny but still uphold it 's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for,0
the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times,0
her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardom,0
in fact all the maps in the game have standard graphics,0
those that get my meaning wo n't stay away from seeing this another week,0
her guilt keeps her from being able to discipline her sons especially the oldest who treats her horribly,0
usually the tv series is splendid even if the story is boring you can trust the acting will make the it worth while,0
in this second film version of the hit play by ben hecht and charles macarthur the front page new york newspaper reporter hildy johnson is now a sassy confident woman,0
half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending and i was regrettably right,0
the haphazard childlike style was masterfully used to further the feeling of unpredictability,0
sometimes you just have to choose says the lead character,0
she warps the movie from a very funny comedy into just another joan crawford tragedy of sorts,0
it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer,0
but if i see no improvement after episode 2 i'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer,0
what do all these people make up,0
it appears to be an attempt at having many seemingly unrelated plot lines coming together at the end like a jigsaw puzzle but the connections are so tenuous and arbitrary that that aspect falls entirely flat,0
was it for his pleasure,0
i recommend it to anyone looking for a good lighthearted comedy,0
it 's not a movie only for christian people to watch i think this movie 's for anyone and i definitely recommend it,0
for example the manager did not go along on the boat with marlow and the rest of the crew the spy did instead,0
just because someone has a degree or is on tv,0
i remember how hopeless some situations were in the favelas and how decadent the society was due to the governments neglect,0
however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some,0
there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others,0
without the right actors this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel,0
oh and one more thing,0
i do think that the choreography is poorly done,0
the director portrayed both cultures bias free,0
everything was terrible from the start,0
he claimed she violated the rules of privacy by looking at private files,0
this is why there are different flavors of ice cream something to please everyone,0
specifically he always knows how to get the warden angry at sam,0
this does not take away from the show but rather allows for the watcher to get to know the characters and to develop their own relationships with them,0
they are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly,0
it is 98 narrated by the british actor paul scofield,0
seeing it second time allowed to actually pay attention to the story more and most of the questions we may have had were answered,0
anyways the battles are poorly done and very short,0
put this film in the trash,0
the producers vote them off,0
why did she commit suicide,0
some may think the movie slow and dull but i find it quite the contrary,0
we tried to watch it again but failed,0
finding the couple 's blanket outside the neighboring house he investigates and finds pam still alive inside a freezer,0
i think people should call this film what it is a total failure and then demand a better product,0
luis llosa must have been on a tight budget,0
it 's funny very funny and like the tagline of the film says you will laugh,0
all the actors were solid in their performances,0
slipknot for those who do n't know is essentially a symphony of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more,0
aside from a stylistically mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act is n't terribly interesting,0
i found this film absolutely terrific,0
if you tried to make a bad film you could not make one worst that this one,0
have an open mind and then let this film work it 's magic on you,0
she finds a way to move into her dead friend 's home with her young child and then starts wearing her clothes and trying to be her,0
the series suffers from a reliance on technobabble never seen before a regular joe does n't understand half of what is being said and the rest phase out due to the internal consistency or lack thereof,0
this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing,0
i just saw the picture on television and i was very angry,0
there 's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop,0
edward arnold is a blind detective with a guide dog named friday,0
in all that year i probably saw the film 10 times,0
with a approaching christmas special which is supposed to tie up the ends for many characters we may soon be saying goodbye to little britain this may not be a bad thing however as its best to go out on top and if it continued i believe it would start to flounder as if series 3 is anything to go by the ideas is simply not there,0
we switched from kicking and screaming to this and we wanted to switch back,0

the movie does a great job of portraying the army in and out of iraq,0
i tolerated the first season,0
name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre more graphic gore is not setting a trend blair witch was absolutely a yawner and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved blair witch what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half sure it was predictable name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that is n't sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between as to protecting people relax those protector 's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks,0
that 's about the only redeeming quality of this movie,0

the same thing over and over no intrigue and where did they find the leading man,0
here she plays a complex women who is supposed to be smart and yet at the same time very dumb,0

everything i hate about films is present fake sentimentality extreme corniness bad child actors and more feature abundantly,0
i would give this film 35 out of 10 it is not worth the time unless you are a fan of virginia woolf 's writing or interested in feminist movies but even then there has been better,0

as for this horror fan all i can say is that i hope there is n't a sequel to this forgettable movie,0

50 of america thought this was a real videotape,0
they are driftwood and waves,0
this film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions,0
it is quite dark and does not suit the film at all,0
i am not one to usually review a movie but this one is personal,0
she could not stand the neighbor or the neighbor 's child due to her insecurities,0
now this is only in the hd version so let 's say the microphones were n't there,0
there 's not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches but when the mayhem escalates it 's plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts,0
the film remains interesting for the duration due to its range of characters and various plot lines,0
there 's a satirical promising opening sequence but the movie steadily loses steam from there,0
the rest of the film however is tripe,0
the few killing scenes to be found are nothing to write home about and most last too short a time to have sufficient impact upon the viewer or even the plot for that matter,0
dr bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it,0
if you 're looking for a good actionadventure story with a complex and engaging plot i would not suggest this film,0
the movie is a little worse than i was expecting,0
it is like if you do n't believe that there is a monster you cannot care about,0
here hitchcock balances the elements and makes for some good details along the way,0
still given these topics nudity and a lot of blood it 's certainly not for children or the squeamish,0
even though years before i was terrified,0
pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary,0
there are no words about loyalty or knowing he 's a good guy deep down but we see it all in the man 's anguished silence and his wife 's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn,0
on the other hand claudette colbert does n't have a great track record with me,0
this was my next step and i must confess that i had never watched this movie before now i'm really glad i watched it,0
let 's through in a conspiracy for the hell of it,0
it starts with a man who calls himself tommy the clown who entertains at children 's parties much like most other types of clowns except that he specializes in an amazing dance performance rather than magic tricks and balloon animals and before long other dancing clown groups are popping up all over the place mostly staffed by kids and teenagers who otherwise would more than likely get involved in a life of crime,0
it 's not clever and it makes it look like a bloody tvmovie,0
she more than any of the other women and girls at the school has a legitimate reason for participating in what happens in the end,0
true connoisseurs of hard action you will not be disappointed,0
i 've gotta say i have seen better acting in a porno,0
then after a few minutes of testosterone fuelled insults and such the truck appeared,0
television has changed so much over the years,0
to my chagrin it did the opposite,0
again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things,0
the good scenery soundtrack cinematography the bad disregards the plot from the blue lagoon sexual overtones rather than undertones more an attempt at capitalizing on the popularity of the original than an extension of the latter 's story comments there are n't many situations that manage to capture the imagination as does watching two children blossom into young adults isolated from civilization on a dessert island,0
while there are certainly some entertaining catfight scenes the rest of the film is incredibly boring,0
as a casual listener of the rolling stones i thought this might be interesting,0
310 second match trish stratus vs mickie james for the wwe women 's championship not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these divas faced off in the ring together,0
and let me tell you disney did something right with a sequel for once,0
another huge factor in their departure was the fact that max and dave fleischer were no longer speaking to one another due to disputes,0
evil ed is a rare gem and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie you did everything right and i love evil ed,0
the story and relationships rang true,0
nick castle directed this hilarious family film that did better then what people give it credit for today,0
this film which raises many issues but provides few clearcut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight,0
for years i 've sought ultimate evil ever since i discovered that plan 9 not only is n't the worst film ever made it probably should n't make the bottom 20 and while i'm always ready eager to audition new candidates night of horror may be it,0
the results are absorbing but like all solondz it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and makes you honestly question your own moral compass,0
the movie also has some silly looking but yet great early special effects toward the ending of the movie,0
i must admit my first impression was it would be just for kids,0
as a final insult said hound is n't even in half the movie as he is conveniently injured or kidnapped for large chunks of it,0
i do n't particularly care for tim meadows or this character from snl but i expected better than this,0
plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to him i would be angry too,0
a kid could watch it without watching an episode of jerry springer,0
i could 've sworn they were directly copied and pasted,0
for me personally the most entertaining feature was the banter between nell and the stooges,0
we 're on it with them it 's sincerely realistic and it 's gorgeous to look at almost all of the time,0
from the cast to the script and the settings,0
nevertheless i 've enjoyed this movie up to its fullest,0
i think the movie should have stuck to the facts,0
very true and faithful to the book,0
luchino visconti the artist with the sword,0
the performances are all excellent and one sequence where frankie calls his broke father for a favor is shattering on so many levels,0
nice try but this is just another inexperienced director who did nothing to back up the veracity of anything presented though stories about prostitutes always sell do n't they,0
forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films,0
the producers of this dung heap probably had the great idea to load up the initial pages with fake positive reviews therefore all the negative reviews are towards the last few pages,0
nora 's been having blackouts and visions that are possibly unrelated to her drinking but she is supposed to quit drinking anyway,0
the many small cameos are also effective even writerdirector mike binder 's role as sandler 's old best friend and accountant,0
think how much better that little diatribe would be if we were watching polley 's reaction while hearing the mother 's words,0
storyline lon was born with an injured face,0
accompanying the beautiful graphics is a great soundtrack reminiscent of the music from the series,0
i remember watching this movie,0
however i still enjoy watching it despite the cheap props lousy story very horrid acting,0
i only found this available as a japanese import,0
the movie is all about the main characters' and their feelings and actions until the operation,0
this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series,0
even arn is described in few details and it is impossible to understand his deep religiosity and respect for all living creatures he developed during the years in the monastery,0
season 6 gave us a stream of tongueincheek comedies that undermined the show 's continuity and frankly made simpsons' halloween specials look like great thriller tv,0
yes lifetime has a habit of making the male species look stupid,0
also for a small film it contains great cinematography and very effective special effects,0
that was a great closing line,0
how many other movies are teaching that to our youth these days,0
with two competent leads one fairly entrancing nemesis seeds of a good story and decent direction one immediately thinks this movie could have been much better,0
there are various reasons for this,0
and what 's with the old woman 's demise crushed to death by her own house,0
neither does his hapless nephew the songs are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down,0
for the particular movie fan the beat that my heart skipped is a slice of intensity wonder and subtlety that can only come from europe,0
who would ever think that the most multilayered film ever is a film about two people who sit down to dinner and talk,0
sherlock holmes telling watson to keep your breath to cool your porridge,0
the two stars dazzle as the couple only heaven could bring together and the supporting cast of bonnie hunt jim belushi and carroll o'connor are just marvelous as well,0
i was n't excited when i watched this movie i was somehow looking forward to the end of it,0
anne hathaway is a great movie star because she can play the buddy thing i mean to say that she is not trying to take over the movie even though she could and i loved that,0
and yes those really are frogs climbing out of the race car 's radiator,0
if chrissie would be survived she tell everyone about it and the family would be masked and we do n't knew hot the remake comes out,0
i went to see this movie prompted by critics that placed it up there in the pantheon of masterpieces,0
and when he tried to it failed miserably,0
you could n't ask for more,0
even in a minor entry like saps at sea one can see that laurel and hardy were great comedians,0
a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow as well,0
i thought it was my wife,0
one of franco nero movies known in my native country as cry onion,0
this was a very good looking film,0
i do n't recommend paying to rent it maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene,0
when done with the butchering the killer releases betty and leaves just to come back for other friends of hers as usual for argento 's films the violence is extremely graphic and very stylized,0
together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable,0
how could this movie get made,0
secondly the irritating science teacher,0
i mean the synopsis sounded really out there,0
but the story is dull and it 's obvious that hitchcock 's heart was n't into this,0
playing no small part in the success of the film is the striking eric clapton theme,0
i play it every year as a tradition and i do n't regret spending my time on it,0
this movie is very very good,0
oddly this very film seems oblivious to that notion,0
at least maclaine 's character knows that she is dumb,0
i 've seen thousands of films and this has got to be the baddest yet not bad in the good sense just plain bad,0
and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort like it would just magically happen,0
this comic book adaptation also has something that many do n't,0
most likely it will only upset them,0
john wayne 's film is a good one if overhyped but it 's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne,0
if nostalgia is in your venue i'm sure this is an interesting movie to see,0
and the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least,0
but like practically everything else in this film that silly picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end,0
the plot is also pretty tenuous and episodic,0
director michael sarne took a lot of flack for the finished film and in honesty it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve,0
i am surprised and glad that the director did not go for a big name in bollywood for role of asha,0
the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it,0
eventually it becomes clear that neither adam nor benson can control the droid and with hector determined to kill anyone who stands in the way of himself and alex that becomes something of a problem if saturn 3 is a story of jealousy and desire then it needs more than a sexstarved droid to generate credibility,0
and what a load of sentimental claptrap it is,0
this time he is not let down by the plot either which sees tibbs caught between the police department and a vigilante gang that seeks to expose a wide net of heroin dealers,0
at one point rock says some poor woman is missing her makeup kit and it led me to wonder if the poor woman was in fact the film 's makeup director,0
at this point there are no other characters to speak of just random passersby whose paths cross with keane 's for brief unsettling moments,0
for '68 this was pretty tame stuff and belies the controversy it attracted at the time,0
there 's genuine hurt in her performance,0
experimentation is admirable even when the experiment does n't work,0
it 's not reality at all it is just stupid it probably even tapes in the day time,0
disturbia may seem like a send up of rear window fright night and a few others but if you can ignore that for once and see it with an open mind you 'll enjoy it,0
it 's so full of clichs your typical nra member will not even like this movie,0
as far as the nature goes icky bingo and turns on mankind genre goes you could do way worse than squirm,0
this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure,0
from this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable,0
if you can stand directors that change history for cash it is an interesting movie reflecting hitler 's personality in a successful way,0
i would have liked the characters developed to a greater extent,0
it 's pretty they did a good job with the cars outfits locations etc but the dialogue is laughable and the way the story was crafted left nothing to suspense,0
the book takes you in more and allows you to relate more to the characters and their feelings,0
unfortunately there is a subplot of scott falling for the daughter of a senile patient,0
with that said the bourne series has been fantastic,0
a deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe an impoverished giovanna has ended up in the gutter but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth,0
the fact is there have been some shocking films made in the name of christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it,0
a few years ago i found out they brought back matthew ashford to play jack so i started watching again,0
music was a little better than the acting,0
the great thing about theatre is it 's enclosed how do you make it available and interesting on screen,0
so does she copy the pages,0
leoni does a good job with deborah but still her character is so twodimensional,0
by chance this movie caught my attention latenight and i was lucky enough to watch from start to finish,0
lots of excuses for scantily clad women but no real plot to speak of emerged in that time,0
of course the otherworldly mythology is the remnant of some vaguely eastern legend based on truth,0
this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie,0
special fx are n't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action is n't going to blow you out of the chair,0
drugs are n't the cause of these characters' downfalls it 's their lousy attitudes these guys passionately drink their cup of poison,0
also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brando 's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of luck be a lady and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra 's version,0
sound a bit too heavy,0
the last time i heard characters repeatedly speak in such a stilted manner was in those old saturday morning cartoons from the 1970s,0
the story steps all over itself and when it finally gets to the final battle its no more than a volleyball match that does n't last long enough to make up with this trashed script raped from the oc,0
the initial premise of a gothic cop and horror movie hybrid is a pretty good idea and certainly prompted me to hire out the film,0
what do you get when you cross an academy award winning director whose movies tend to follow the lives of individuals and their consequences of the violence around them an award winning writer that deals with racism and the map of the human spirit and a producer that has a penchant for world war ii history who is a master of telling epic stories on the widescreen canvas,0
why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white,0
the film 's finale is especially memorable on that front,0
i really enjoyed this movie and even more so the second time,0
classic monster costuming and effects are used,0
if you like going out with a small group of friends on a friday night looking for something to do this movie will remind you of all those good times,0
it basically ruins the fun of horror movies to begin with,0
maybe the public still remembered lucky lindy 's antisemitism and his loud admiration for nazi germany 's achievements before the war,0
watched uzumaki last night and right away was reminded of two early peter weir films from australia the last wave and picnic at hanging rock,0
to an extent the movie does show how doctors are willing conspirators or accomplices in the process,0
he is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show,0
the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven,0
the music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible,0
once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment,0
this movie borrows from the core and from the film it borrowed from armageddon and the films it borrowed from and so on,0
there are much better pornographic theme movies than this one,0
not enough movies like this are made today,0
if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere,0
not this movie which somehow manages to become even more loathsome,0
i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did 29 years ago,0
my interpretation of the story is very simple after finding her beloved husband cheating her with the nanny of their children danika becomes an insecure stressed and overprotective mother affecting her professional life,0
the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor,0
it 's just one continuation of hilarious moments and parodies on famous people and movies,0
i have just completed my review number 1000 in imdb and i choose before sunrise for this significant number because it is a very special film for me,0
beauty and the beast is great in another aspect it 's ageless,0
it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the animal 's attraction with one female,0
albeit even set in 1951 a bit late one might think,0
nothing with will ferrell or adam sandler can crack my to ten,0
this movie is a great christmas movie and is amazing,0
overall knowing this is a first movie and was made by a guy who never made a movie before it was great,0
he 's never seen again,0
please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they 're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create,0
right from the beginning the film draws you in and never lets up on the tension,0
and just just do n't get me started on the ending,0
edward is portrayed as the seducer but wallis does n't exactly play hard to get,0
it might well be my last unless a worse movie comes along and i would n't make book that will happen,0
see it if you can locate a copy,0
it feels like john did n't have much to work with here,0
either way he 's a political coward and party man to the bitter end,0
the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting,0
all i can say is give it 11 out of 10,0
the film and its actors won several awards,0
the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him but the other agencies were portrayed positively,0
the planning seemed to be very mature,0
not only is the movie not a romance but its characters lack any personality,0
yes they do have the stereotypical sorority and fraternity but it 's not mocking but just cute humor,0
i am finally seeing the el padrino movie from what i can see it is an incredible film and lots of action damian chapa is good director but i must admit i love his acting the best,0
the warrior path paradoxically does not lead to wanton violence but rather effectively eliminates it,0
ayres was already a star due to all quiet on the western front,0
he changed his mind but then was afraid to move,0
and when it comes to his family they too are just as candid it 's a little depressing to be sure to see the state of his brothers and the tales of his father,0
to all intents and purposes this is an inferior when harry met sally for a younger generation,0
someone once asked me whats the inhabitants of the isle of mute called mutants,0
but some roles are unrealistic ie,0
come to think of it this makes a great party movie,0
watch at your earliest convenience,0
and sam elliot gary busey chris noth george hamilton and all the rest of the cast are outstanding,0
no one else seems to be putting any effort in except frank finlay who chronically overacts,0
not so the case with ghost lake,0
all in all this affirms ron howard as a director who always has some ideas,0
in my opinion jack cassidy is by far the best murderer in the columbo series,0
i can vividly recall the the emotions of the host who greeted them at the pit stop however coming in last place eliminated them from the race,0
i think it was a decent film,0
sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day tap tap tapping,0
as a devoted fan of rutger hauer i 've seen some crappy productions,0
desperate housewives almost did n't make it to the airwaves because marc cherry was selling it as a farce and people did not know what that was,0
i always like to conclude a review by saying something positive but this time it 's hard,0
also i think that the ending they chose makes sense,0
i give this a 3,0
doris is very curvy and plump in this movie she looks tough and looks like she could let the limping cagney have it and run so he could n't catch her yet doris portrays ruth as weak so it makes me wonder what the real ruth etting was really like the real ruth looks so frail and innocent she looks as though you could knock her over with a feather but i hear she was tougher than doris portrayed her but i guess the movie was more interesting portrayed ruth as naive and gullible,0
the series featured a new york hotel which had fallen on hard times,0
mchugh is a petty crook who runs into mcmahon another crook who is posing as a countess,0
the right stuff is the real thing,0
you could call this plagiarism or homage depending on your agenda,0
why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women,0
even more disturbing is that these films are hideous for the same exact reasons 1 awful screenplay,0
some critics have compared chop shop with the theatrical releases of city of god and pixote,0
my rating 77 out of 10 feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here,0
it 's obvious they did not use a military consultant or if they did the producers were taken for a long ride because there was next to nothing accurate about the portrayal of things military,0
the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavyhanded they were still fun,0
no it 's a cameraman on speed,0
when milo comes looking for glory an altercation erupts that basically sets up the conflict and what happens in the rest of the movie,0
especially with the help of the marvellous music used in scenes and masterful film editing again by chang,0
man do n't mock me you bitch,0
but the odd thing is that we have austen in australia the role and all the expectations without the baroque mechanics of society swirling around,0
with hunter 's blood the emphasis is on action rather than characterization or drama,0
so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic man to man does n't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head,0
i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music,0
if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film,0
i have done a complete internet search and cannot find any information on this case,0
its set up like a b horror movie and it fulfills that niche very well,0
overall this is a really horrible movie and you definitely should n't waste your time with it,0
will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters,0
from this point any semblance of a coherent story falls apart as she meets the other girlfriends but never really spends any time actually talking to them,0
this movie is about finding love in everybody 's differences,0
i watch it as often as i could and i still have n't enough good humor,0
this does n't really make sense and does n't work,0
there is little or no dramatic build up and some of the performances are so bad they have to be seen to be believed,0
in a day when movies all seem to be effects combined with pretty faces this was a refreshing interlude,0
the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and i'm sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sht could easily cover the costs it took to make it,0
a difficult choice has to be made continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart,0
oh man i hated this movie,0
zombie '90 is hilarious so nevermind the harsh words although extreme pestilence still only deserves one star,0
everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama,0
it 's not an unhappy movie though exactly the opposite,0
then why do i hate this so much,0
and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out,0
they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece fay grim,0
if you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters,0
but here they did such a rare fatal mistake and i'm surely talking about the weird ending,0
the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible,0
there were a few charged symbols to look for,0
i can assure you that she is not in the movie at all,0
there was surely no need for narration why do i need some doofus to read what 's on the screen for me,0
remember the coneheads on snl,0
highest praise goes david tennant and sarah parish for their incredible performances,0
gregg araki was both the writer and director on the film,0
a group of bad ninjas just happen to be attempting to take over the park for a ransom while they are there,0
her scenes with cole hauser were electrifying,0
and peter sarsgaard as the young writer gives a complex performance as a man who quickly learns the ways of manipulation from experts,0
no it 's not a there 's something about mary farce,0
well i hope you enjoy it as much as i did,0
did jimmy cameron get tired of his own idea,0
they might get instructions by computer but they are steered by humans as the sea is too unpredictable,0
a number of reviewers seemed to be blown away by this movie,0
this movie is a leftwing loony 's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen,0
second there 's no plot,0
the 1995 version however did include part of austen 's original ending,0
foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit,0
too bad they do n't exist anymore,0
in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified,0
the camerawork is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable,0
i love all of these plays,0
there caine and ms cannon discuss a new play called deathtrap written by hunky young christopher reeve one of caine 's former students,0
how this movie even made it to release is beyond me,0
i hate this movie but compared to others it should have won an academy award,0
the acting in this movie is n't terrible but the script is pretty bad and overall it 's pretty boring and it does n't even contain any nudity to somewhat redeem it,0
she chokes on her lines and is never steady in any scene,0
then as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene fischer says something to the effect of do n't tell,0
furst plays a baddie this time out and has one of the best scenes when he asks his dad why ca n't you just accept me for who i am,0
however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever,0
therefore it could have been better,0
in other words it 's not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they 're getting,0
besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing,0
frustrated because it could have been fantastic,0
anyway i'm done i hope i 've scared a few people of,0
this movie tried really hard to be a good little gay themed movie and coming of age film in general but it was done in by its flaws,0
every single thing about murder game was bad i cannot think of one thing that was remotely good about this film,0
the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right,0
the end of the film shows phillip now free to love sally,0
just talking it is so refreshing to listen to people talk here we must read subtitles as well,0
it is a truly terrifying scene as a couple of fugitives on the run from the law tear apart an innocent family living in a secluded country cottage by killing the mother and father,0
the first reviews which drew me to watch kekexili compared it to the great american westerns so i 'll start with the differences,0
the message in most of his books and this movie is about that your thoughts in fact is what causes your problems and that the reason of your anger hardly ever is caused of what you think of,0
he 's not charismatic enough to play the great mexican revolutionary,0
fi you want to watch a movie that does n't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it,0
even the serious characters suffer from this type of contrived sloppy scripting where a character suddenly reveals he 's a helicopter pilot which leads me to ask why the army have been employing him to drive jeeps for a career obviously you 're reminded of the earlier film the crazies which also reminded me of the later 28 films,0
the characters could have been handled better,0
but the characters evolving against this canvas remain underdeveloped,0
keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three this is scarecrow gone wild,0
if you are a movie director and you actually think it 's ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears left over from your rough edit and you apparently ca n't muster the energy to edit those frames out then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting,0
i give it a 1010 one of the best i have seen,0
in my view this was a great class b movie,0
the two tigers that attacked the horses in the movie could not have been any more fake,0
this is an intimate movie of a sincere girl in the real world out of hollywood 's cheap fantasy is a very good piece of its class and ashley judd fills the role impeccably,0
i loved every episode of those,0
belle mitchell who previously had appeared in house of frankenstein and the beast with five fingers also stars as the landlady of the boarding house where the title character stays,0
i was in the film too but i do n't know if they actually put this scene in,0
i mean you have to ground this in some level of reality,0
just take a well respected british or australian actor make things look pretty and you 're guaranteed a formula for oscar success,0
some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watch,0
and you can read that in as you watch and appreciate those nuances for yourself though they 're not spelled out in the film,0
coburn makes for a superb boozy center playing very much against his hipster image and giving the film a gravitas it sorely needs,0
i think it could touch so many more lives like it did my own,0
economic growth is predicated upon more electricity,0
i'm trying to figure out if we 're suppose to be scared or not,0
mixed with this is a made up dickens' novel which also deals with a murder story,0
we 'd fallen asleep by then,0
i think that we should see it the way that it really is a beauty contest,0
but i am very very nervous,0
of course part of the reason for the acclaim was that folks marveled how hitchcock on such a skimpy budget as compared to lavish hollywood products was able to provide so much on the screen,0
lionel barrymore is sympathetic to ms marsh desiring to help her recover the runaway dogs,0
most of the time he 's standing about asking questions and that 's about it,0
fantastic movie truly heartbreaking but very well made,0
otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence,0
r o b o t j o x burn the master,0
pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists the cops and some marines,0
he finds out who initiated the attack but the cops are not called in,0
i recommend it strongly for people who like good fighting enjoy the cultural traditions of china and enjoy the robust humor typical of this genre,0
he pals around with his two partners and they work hard by day and party harder at night,0
end of spoilers i ca n't say how this movie compares to the others in the puppet master series but on a standalone basis it was entertaining enough,0
also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue,0
you 're not trying very hard to escape master escape artist,0
bravo tim burton and cast,0
make yourself happy and watch excalibur have some dignity,0
one of the cleverest and most suspense filled books i 've ever read,0
do n't they make enough money from their questionably silly investments already,0
but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your lifeand want to reaffirm the ones that continue,0
it 's so heavyhanded it makes you sick,0
the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into the fragments as portrayed in the movie would require a comet around the size of the moon itself,0
this movie was pretentious foppish and just down right not funny,0
35 out of 5 stars,0
this makes the story more interesting than the usual dirty harry fare,0
i recommend it especially if you do n't require that you grow spiritually or expand your vocabulary every time you invest 90 minutes in a movie,0
when one thinks how many documentaries have been made about the nazi oppression of jews roma and other groups it is almost inconceivable that it is only in the year 2000 67 years after the nazi persecution of male homosexuals started that a documentary on the subject is finally released,0
while the soviet partisans accomplished much against the germans many of them were far from being the heroes which soviet propaganda claimed,0
ok i'm being a little mean it 's all good we do have some good chick flicks and from the moment i saw bride wars i thought it looked promising,0
what kills panic is that it 's dull and unexciting,0
too bad because there are several fine performances in millenium including joy kristofferson and several of the supporting players,0
the film would have benefited by staying with just one or two of its moods,0
the most irritating and terminal flaw is that while watching this movie one is keenly aware that the makers and participants think they are making a much smarter movie than they are,0
the dialog was n't very good at all,0
they payed her 2500 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august,0
even on the beach with gregory peck ava gardner and fred astaire for endoftheworld scenarios,0
you just do n't understand,0
let 's just give the enemy what they want and go on our way because then they 'll be satisfied and leave us alone,0
as garrett james coburn fares much better with a stylish and graceful performance that exudes a cool confidence despite being in conflict with himself,0
the big twist was n't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working,0
he played that role perfectly with the accent and everything and i believe its one of his finest works,0
takes all kinds i guess,0
the problem with this is that it 's virtually impossible to avoid the color red on a daily basis meaning young ricky would have heart attacks every time he got a test back graded with red marker,0
she was outgoing and friendly,0
i ca n't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it especially when they said it was dangerous to go there,0
if this is the first action movie you have ever seen then you might love it otherwise it should be avoided at all cost,0
it really is a fun little film with a bunch of faces you did n't know were in it,0
this movie reflects i think hollywood 's disdain for the average moviegoer and shows just how out of touch hollywood 's writers and directors are,0
very little works in this pretentious garbage,0
i will say in the films defense that the speech about why the wedding should go on is a great piece of writing,0
sherlock would never have done such a thing,0
a little gem of a film i would recommend you seek this out,0
he 's so totally different you ca n't blame claudette for not recognizing him i could barely,0
the waferthin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world 's largest nightclub where they are picked off by an unseen assailant,0
violent fun with a porno soundtrack,0
there 's no explanation for the transformation but without it the film 's scenarist will not be able to pull of the clumsy scene in the film 's denouement when joe takes the place of honus in the last game of the 1909 world series,0
it 's like he decided to take certain cues from kubrick via 2001 and from just general nature documentaries in order to capture the sort of alien aspect to this all,0
it ends with a mother grieving over the body of her son by the same river probably in 1949 in between there 's little real narrative just haunting shots of villages and cities and groups of people running back and forth and music,0
there are so many things wrong with this it 's unbelievable,0
the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art,0
young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines,0
i am a fan of christopher lambert but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too,0
they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it,0
i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones,0
so what was it that made it all stick with me,0
is it just me or does this family learn a valuable lesson every day,0
back comes the previously fat and unattractive goldie but instead she is thin and looks even younger than she looked decades ago,0
the songs definitely add on to the story but have such strong character themselves that they have their own identity even outside the film,0
i urge people not to see this movie,0
shu qi and vicki zhao make for the cutest sisters you 'll ever see on screen,0
this film has heart it has humour it has action,0
it will henceforth dominate the social patterns of american living,0
the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that,0
it is by no means an important movie but rather one that you can watch on a rainy afternoon or enjoy again if you have n't seen it for awhile,0
you do n't like this flick maybe chuck will come and beat you up,0
the thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows whispers and implications,0
messiah is a great thriller a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims' tongues and replaces them with silver spoons,0
i 'd expect this kind of production from a high school independent films class but come on this is supposed to be the big leagues step it up a bit,0
i'm not quite sure why everyone is bashing this movie,0
the director and the producer 's must have been nut 's to think the abomination was even good for a b movie,0
i just saw this film at the phoenix film festival today and loved it,0
you gotta watch these two on a doublebill,0
the movie is rather slowly paced but offers a very adult story for western fans,0
in fact i apologize to you,0
glenn close reprises her role as cruella de vil and once again is the highlight of the film,0
the problem with this film is that its lacking in what made the first 2 films popular,0
the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise is that we are watching an extremely talented actor pacino seemingly playing a parody of himself,0
there was the use of the word coffers at the end of the movie,0
the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters except for a little cornball dignity in the priest,0
one of the strengths of this film is character development,0
in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie,0
the movie has you know that all hope you will gain for these characters is futile that life is never that easy,0
also another thing working against this movie is the fact that unless you 've been living under a rock you 've seen a hollywood superhero movie in the past decade,0
not only was it overly long but it seemed like the director only had a budget of 10 to film what turned out to be nothing more than a meandering incoherent pointless piece of drivel masquerading as high art,0
when the leonard cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universe,0
instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so wellchosen so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978,0
cinema just does n't get better than this,0
this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama,0
this film was on late at night when i saw it,0
unfortunately this film fizzled at the box office and hawn herself later said she made a mistake,0
years after gymkata was released it became a perennial late night cable movie and as a result i 've been able to make up for lost time,0
how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck,0
the relatively uplifting ending gave hope for those affected by the initial tragedy,0
what 's missing is the soul of the book,0
the plot revolving around several teens escaping death feels right out of final destination only there 's no clever death 's it pretty much turns into a really awful teen slasher as the grim reaper becomes your average freddy kruger type killer,0
i would encourage buying the movie great for parties or anytime you want to good laugh,0
the plot is simplistic and predictable the characters one dimensional and clichd,0
the us got involved in bosnia and somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to iraq,0
in all a lot of eyerolling went on,0
to be fair the slasher slant is not a new one,0
i know it is n't easy for lesbians even in the us even today,0
someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the egyptians,0
it is difficult to describe the jawdropping awfulness of locusts nor is there any point in attempting the job,0
casey investigates the nearby electricity plant,0
throughout the movie the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of paxton 's character the impact on the children and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct,0
i especially liked the opening scene which showed the power workout before breakfast,0
it 's not the worst movie i 've ever seen but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants i pray that they are deluded,0
the female lead is the woman who starred in mannequin and she 's the best actress in there,0
that alone makes this movie a must see,0
well personally i do n't know why you people are so hating against this movie,0
it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride,0
william shatner 's appearance did n't help,0
attention was somewhat lacking after twenty five minutes of this film,0
i do n't find his character or any of the other players here believable for one second,0
there 's an unreal quality about the whole thing so that the overall effect is like watching a marionette show under water,0
basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie,0
its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness,0
and why were they going there,0
first off the film was intended for children much like the original show was,0
honest scathing look at alternative cartoonist and his family,0
bumbling college student dexter riley develops a mysterious liquid invisibility formula that actually makes objects disappear and helps him to save his cash strapped college,0
for it is the doom of men that they forget,0
but even bigger than that is the true sense of mystery that this film evokes regarding art,0
i liked this better than valley of the dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well,0
do n't waste your time on this movie,0
he sure seemed to throw like one,0
the nun choir songs were nowhere near as polished as the first movie,0
the movie is plagued by it 's low budget,0
here 's what to rent for walter matthau the odd couple,0
the ending quite simply had me gasping,0
the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming so it just does n't come across well,0
and they play this clip over and over and over and over and you get the point,0
the vampire in her little film is about to suck the blood from a virgin,0
a veteran such as henry fonda should be better in choosing his projects and do better with the material at hand,0
the movie gives a feeling as though it were done to show off a few grossout special effects and not much more but the special effects did n't come out that good and they did n't have enough money to reshoot,0
not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet,0
one of the most popular mario bava 's movies bay of blood starts in this fashion with a lengthy strangling scene,0
not to mention the daily chores and regular haircuts,0
stallone has never been a favorite of mine but when he is acting circles around lithgow turner and the worst of the bunch rooker there is something wrong with this picture,0
kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine,0
some people simply wo n't get it at all,0
i read somewhere the whole movie was done in several weeks some tv episodes take longer but do n't look it,0
his nemesis a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man looks like a banana republic model twenty years younger than him,0
the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago,0
for example while considering vertigo iek states that what 's hidden behind human face is a perfect void which makes face itself only a facade something of a deception in its own means,0
the best role peter strauss ever did,0
i omitted to mention that i managed to get in to the film free so i can afford to laugh about it,0
where did these people learn acting,0
its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential,0
in fact at times she physically looks a lot like the director liv ullmann,0
her name is julia because she was named by her mother julie not by the publisher,0
it is the rolling stones at their absolute lowest point,0
i 'd stick with 'where the day takes you' if this is the kind of movie you desire,0
all children everywhere will see that pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured,0
the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat has our rogue cop hero found a soulmate in this lady vigilante,0
i warn you not to waste your time on this disgusting excuse for a film,0
its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book,0
harrison ford did justice with his outstanding performance as the president,0
not only do twists seem like cheats but they 're just unbelievable to start with,0
his helpers are ugly misanthropic overthetop and mean,0
also it seemed like she was reading her lines,0
if you have n't seen it do so,0
this can easily be edited into a television movie of the week,0
now this movie has everything,0
director john frankenheimer does a superlative job with this and films like the manchurian candidate black sunday and ronin,0
i did not know that this was possible using a database storage device,0
too much rat pack perhaps anyway judy lives forever in my gay heart and this made her a star,0
instead we get mia farrow and jeff daniels in what has to be the most original role of his career as the man who walks off the movie screen and into farrow 's humdrum life,0
in filming he actually seemed to be in the moment and connecting on an honest level when you were talking to him,0
if they had n't pretended this was a phantom of the opera movie titled it something else given our phantom a name a few minor changes with the plot i may have liked the film and afterward said hey parts of that kinda reminded me of the phantom of the opera,0
if something from the past was brought into the present it would have no effect on the past,0
realizing that ice cream does n't make kids happy balloons do n't make kids happy cars do n't make adults happy,0
clint eastwood has created a masterpiece of film,0
stay away from this one at all costs,0
i am also against violence but the character loses credibility when he stays unmoved despite all the attacks,0
i really did n't have high expectations and i must admit that i was n't disappointed,0
the first time was hilarious but again,0
i expected an oldschool edgy italian cop thriller that was made in america,0
it is redeemed by the fact that you may find some solace in ripping your teeth into the many many flaws you will no doubt find,0
it 's kinda like a mix between guy richie and david lynch just without the bullst,0
finally there is the murder of the holocaust which also has an explicit portrayal in the film,0
first rip the girl in the road who has escaped from the psycho is ripped right out of the texas chainsaw massacre,0
although it probably was van gogh 's intention it totally does n't feel like an artistic piece of cinema as there 's no style to detect anywhere,0
a curious failure from producers aaron spelling leonard goldberg,0
i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie,0
it may be the first time in my life that i actually felt sorry for the actors who really were at the mercy of this doomed screenplay,0
i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece,0
i wo n't list all the bad things because there 's a lot of them but here 's a few of the most prominent,0
it 'll still make you laugh continuously but not as hard as the first time you saw it when what was coming was a surprise,0
this 1954 film was clearly a vehicle for an aging barbara stanwyck even though the woman in the story must have been in her twenties,0
even more unbelievable is an aging balding director finding instant sex with the most beautiful chick in town though gravity is already getting to miss marceau at a youthful age,0
it 's a story that we can all find a piece of ourselves in,0
there are explosions and the screen play is spot on,0
i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say at last,0
you have wonder about the wisdom of even attempting to convert a book which is powerful tribute to the power of words and language and turning into a wouldbe powerful tribute to gwyneth paltrow,0
the director knows how to create a disturbing scary setting with the correct use of light sounds and suspense,0
i 'll start with saying come on,0
the only reason i gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a is this for real,0
for starters i did n't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet,0
all of the lions are interesting although larry can get annoying at times,0
all of the actors seem as though they would rather be somewhere else,0
you watch because people are so blind to their shortcomings,0
jeff morrow is so bad in this i'm shocked to see he still had a career afterward,0
tracks is supposed to be about young teenagers 14 to 16 years of age being tried as adults and placed in an adult jail,0

what is particularly amusing is the presentation of the one world ruler,0
one never really gets a chance to get into these movies because of all the byplay,0

i have not read thomas mann 's book but i am certain that visconti 's visual splendour musical score and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice,0
in lesser hands it would have degenerated into an erotic thriller made for directtovideo,0
the film was slow until the ending the director absolutely used his time unwisely scenes that were presented in 10 minutes could of been reduced down to 3 the actors played their role and basically anything else was pretty good,0
go look at my review of being john malkovich,0

lewis wanted his books to be enjoyed by young people who would later in their lives draw the spiritual meanings from the stories,0

the killer is often knocked over andor falls unconscious,0
this was yet another weak video game based anime like fatal fury,0

even a day when the whole world is falling down around them,0
that 's exactly interactive art,0
in fact there are a lot of truthful moments in it,0
it could 've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character it still would 've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity his inquisitive mind his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images his sense of humor his childhood dreams his fantasies dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do,0
that scream you just heard was my soul dying,0

in 1914 charlie chaplin began making pictures,0
if you enjoy bad movies go for it,0
here he plays a dignified and wealthy suburban doctor in a loving marriage to normand,0
corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience,0
reno too seems miscast as a romantic lead but sometimes the quiet ones can sneak up on one too right,0
much effort was put into getting the details just right,0
also other characters such as marlow the manager and the fianc did n't do the characters justice that they deserved from the book,0

you ride through trees on your bike,0
there is no inkling of why teddy roosevelt appointed him to the us supreme court and we are left with very little notion of why roosevelt was disappointed with holmes other than that holmes wrote a few opinions that teddy did n't like,0

what really makes a horror movie is the violence,0
while it purported to portray the monkees' story the plot was weak or nonexistent,0
i have to wonder what movie some of these other reviewers watched,0

i was perfectly content with the plot,0
for some reason when this film was first shown there were segments which portrayed the poisoning of marie 's mother and that she initially lived in a trailer,0

what i found were actors trapped in their predictable roles with only rare genuine emotions expressed,0

what saves it is of course miss taylor 's beauty magnificent scenery the very impressive elephant stampede and a wellmade point on human arrogance in the face of nature,0
this is so obviously overdone to lay on the antiwar propaganda that it comes across as simply long outrageous and contrived,0
title a viva de saintpierre,0
everything is supposed to be funny but it is n't,0
please future writers producers directors learn from this movie,0
it lacks any semblance of mood or atmosphere,0
and the ending was absolutely fantastic,0
it seems to exist only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to 'star' in this cinematic laughfest,0
i found the story to be pretty weak to say the least,0
this happens about four times,0
this is the first disney movie i 've seen in the theaters done by the television animation department and it will definitely be the last,0
first of all the actors,0
and with a movie like this once the audience starts to lose interest the look of the film does n't amount to a hill of beans anymore,0
of course 99 of the men are jerks it was written during that era,0
one of my favorite scenes is woody trying to meet an attractive woman at a museum,0
even i who love the genre struggled to sit through this,0
a fine lightweight coming home comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining,0

the fights were on the verge of comical comical in the bad way not the good way as the original was,0
this is together with das boot one of the best war movies,0
seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me,0
it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come,0
imo the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama,0

i feel like the ending made a little flaw to the film but it 's still acceptable for me,0

the direction is all shaky cameras weird angles mono cuts to colour etc,0
ok this was oliver stone 's first movie so i 'll cut him some slack,0
ca n't wait to see what this director will do with name actors and a bigger budget,0
but there was something there,0
beyond this the reality of the movie is quite different,0
it 's a really brilliant,0
they are doing what they gotta do i guess,0
mary steenburgen won a supporting oscar as dummar 's first wife a dreamer like melvin who is far less satisfied with struggling and who just wants to amount to something,0
someone spent some money on this,0
this is a good movie and outside of the way it happens the end is satisfying,0
the balance between drama and comedy is n't always maintained as with the new classical genre of this type but the real message and motivation for this movie remains solid,0

following the murder reporter donald woods sought to get biko 's message out to the world,0
the film makes a point that the farmers see barely 25 of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other crops,0

i understand that christmas movies are normally heartwarming sweet and touching,0
he even makes a joke once but we 're afraid his face might crack,0
i could not touch them or talk to them yet they seemed to welcome me with open arms as i silently watched their lives unfold before me,0
the film is hard on the nerves to watch as all depictions of depravity and death are,0
one by one they drop dead,0
however it 's one thing to see cagney as a gritty mobster in films like public enemy and white heat where his aggression is expressed as an enemy of society,0

my whole family absolutely love the film and have watched it so many times i have lost count,0
ruth is will martin 's grandmother,0
unfortunately one must try to ignore all the goofs to enjoy this movie and it is not all that easy because there are so many of them,0
this is the material we waited 14 years for,0
the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half,0
although a little slow initially various techniques keep the viewer 's interest piqued right through until christie 's trademark denouement,0
the plot was interesting revolving around the timeless theme of redemption,0
a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history far superior to any films being made these days,0
horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered and neither is the audience 's tolerance for slow moving garbage,0
i also do not understand why one would like this movie regardless of their sense of humor,0
all it is is just a quick way to make some money though,0
not as predictable as i assumed it would be,0
i first saw this in a theater may god forgive me i was laughing so hard i was rolling off my seat and so too with most of the rest of the audience,0
for some reason i have never forgotten that scene,0
this is a stupid film in my eyes boring at times not entertaining just a film that i would n't recommend to anybody,0
serling was forced to go this route after suffering from censorship early in his career that prevented him from directly addressing current social concerns with criticism that might offend the advertisers,0
he is in 13 out of the 16 episodes and has some good but relatively short scenes in there,0
the action is n't half bad although the cgi for a bit in a boat is pretty poor,0
they obviously did fantastic but the leads in this film are completely different people who have there own acting methods and should n't be pressured of what people have to say,0
however i stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film,0
never mind a piece of magic,0
also i love the way they decided to bleep out the words,0
and yes i know benoit was a heel in that one but vince was an idiot to make him one in the first place,0
he did n't deserve the treatment that people like bytes the person working at the hospital gave him,0
clearly the sister creators of this movie have spent some time as temps,0
as actors only jacobs seemed to mail it in but i think he was trying to play his character just a bit too cool so it just seemed like he was sleepwalking,0
a few years later i unfortunately sold both the soundtrack and video for some extra cash,0
all in all a terrible movie,0
michael douglas as steven taylor is absolutely brilliant and sinister and the best aspect of this story is that you do n't find out why he wants really wants his wife murdered until later in the movie,0
walt disney 's 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself and is not generally considered to be among their very best output,0
it did n't in the case of serum anyhow,0
he is one of the most natural actors i have ever seen,0
when i sat down to watch this film i had a nagging doubt that daniel craig would n't be able to fill the shoes of his predecessors,0
these are just kids doing what kids do without consciousness,0
i think there 's 5 movies altogether,0
aired on public television and hard to find these days,0
the christian film industry has n't learned from the failures of this so we are stuck with the omega code left behind and the other tribulation movies,0
and the girls can really rock too,0
and we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production,0
so for a great story great acting and a little comedy i give radio a 10 out of 10,0
i'm officially rather fed up with mme huppert 's screen method which is too buried and so i 'll be looking to see her on stage before i come back to her films again,0
and it never told us what happened to her father,0
an increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people 's heads exploding brings a young professor 's apprentice stefan to investigate,0
i liked some parts of this film mostly because of its chicago location shots but i thought the film 's production values were very low budget for a hollywood film,0
while the history and nostalgia about fairies is perhaps somewhat interesting there is never any rational argument used to justify their existence,0
i'ts just not the same,0
after all moviewatching is a matter of managing your expectations,0
no one should waste their time,0
that would just be silly,0
this movie was frustrating because of the slow moving story,0
most people on the board seem to really hate this film,0
dan 's eyes are opened,0
this is the greatest show ever made next to south park,0
sonatine presents a real story of the mobster tired of a trade he is being squeezed out of by rivals,0
only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized,0
i'm a huge make that huge fan of the tv show so i had always wanted to see the movie that started it all,0
most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower,0
the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at smart people and average joes like the protagonists,0
and the oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to dwight frye,0
also i would love to see more from the creative talents behind this series so impressed am i,0
some can find the film lowbrow some can find it patriotic,0
too bad the story is not all that good and mr cage sometimes loses his accent,0
captain damian is the unpopular rookie who 'll really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous captain churchill,0
colby was annoying and they had too much crap about discovering your inner self,0
it has perfect lighting perfect costumes perfect music perfect acting but oh the plot is just so dull and lacking in substance,0
and i do n't think that i needed to,0
seeing there are only 3 user comments i feel bad for so many films like this,0
i guess that if you like the old dark shadows series then maybe you 'll like this,0
i'ts a same that i did n't know of it earlier,0
also forget about any sexy scenes the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque you would sooner puke than get turned on,0
is it too much to expect a bit of wit and some good dialogue even from a cartoon action movie,0
but there can be too much of a good thing,0
try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy,0
it was like the writer and later the director thought this was a good way to just end it as they were bored,0
i 'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one,0
hard to write 1000 words for this b movie,0
destiny is the running theme of the movie where each character is destined for certain goals and events and one in which is set in stone,0
not only her guru has passed away the arts foundation founded by her guru is left abandon,0
that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie,0
the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game,0
its excruciatingly dull to watch the game both at the poker table and between bond and 'the girl' because we all know where its going and its not fun,0
he has to save his daughter and the police chief 's son,0
get ready for some spoilers though i must say it is n't spoiling much,0
five its vision of the world,0
said students learn of the local legend of dr satan but get sidetracked by obnoxious hitchhiker baby who brings our zeroes home for a night of torture terror and totally gross overacting by her kin the fireflies,0
yet over the next few months astonishingly nadine and owen become pals who confide in each other and hang out,0
perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role and the men actors had more emotion then the film could have had a chance,0
the initial impression made by 'natural born killers' was one of overkill literally,0
not far away at all,0
paul hogan plays crocodile dundee exactly the way he played it fifteen years ago,0
there is a particularly nasty scene involving an electronic paper guillotine and someone 's thumb but everyone 's reaction to the event is stone faced and it grows back within the hour,0
with identity the movie suddenly pulls a fast one on you and leaves you wondering but mangold does n't gives the twist at the very end and keeps a tense film until the last frame,0
this adds to the appeal the descriptions chick flick weeper women 's picture can not apply,0
unfortunately blood dolls was n't even a movie terrible enough to laugh at,0
however cary simply loves his real wife so the problem was how to get legally rid off the new wife and to come back again to her real one,0
this is n't cops cops makes it work as it tells the risks that go along with being a police officer,0
something about the muppets always got my confused like why are the muppets ironically related to the puppets,0
anyhow dracula rips frank 's head off and as he 's running back to the castle the sun kills him and turns him into a skull with gray hair,0
there was quite a fair breeze too blowing from the west,0
but no off they go to break into a restricted area,0
so my advice is do n't watch this film,0
fatty arbuckle is the definite star of this short despite buster keaton 's appearing in the film as well,0
memory which it seems this film is about is perverse,0
moreover petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of air force one with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in das boot,0
to those who do n't like it you miss the point and a great ending to phenomenal beginning,0
a boy gets bit by a snake and the dad a fireman from new york somehow gets the boy to walk,0
the klingons make a tacked on appearance which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie,0
however the principal acting is a bit weak,0
the main virtue of death on the nile is agatha christie 's unbeatable whodunit plot which is arguably even more beautifully constructed than that of murder on the orient express,0
particularly the veteran actor george sanders is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production,0
the ending was hilarious even though i have found many who disagree with me on that one,0
he was extremely difficult to work with under other directors and would have been hard to control,0
i thought the actors were pretty bad,0
in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the makingof documentary the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film a theatrical release version and a restored version,0
it 's incredibly funny too and my teenage sons kept laughing right along with me at the smart comebacks,0
there 's a lot of whose been sleeping in my bed antics before the truth about the island is uncovered,0
at that time i did n't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had,0
he 's also having a hard time adjusting to civilian life,0
the conversations are totally pretentious with the characters making sweeping generalizations about the nature of their relationships and very existences,0
i have n't even seen a home movie that was this bad,0
it has every thing a movie should have,0
in the end the movie does not resolve any of the problems nor give us a fairy tale ending,0
i do n't expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made do n't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script,0
i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking when is it going to end,0
if ward does n't look like the embodiment of a 1940s film goddess i do n't know who does,0
but if other countries like china iran south korea and argentina can make films that have a realistic message and which many more people can relate to why cannot the indian film industry,0
in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself,0
the cavern 2 out of 10 blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache,0
i used to watch it several times a week,0
i think what impressed me the most was the special effects,0
she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans who in contrast to herself is a supporter of the revolution,0
this movie should be shown to film students everywhere,0
alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft,0
i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something,0
they do a good job of helping the viewer wrap realism around the why,0
with windows opening a subtle breeze or gust of wind in the house and figures looking into the window,0
the animation is amazing and to watch handdrawn animation is a real breath of fresh air to all the computer animation we see today,0
i enjoy the kind of outlandish stories like the one found in fedora,0
all in all watchable for bogie who is always a master and certainly a story that will hold your interest,0
and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger 's legs,0
what i really tried to figure out when i was watching this movie is why do all these stars show up in this movie the only explanations i can think of is that they lost a bet or the cast was blowing their heads off during filming,0
in fact i recommend this method,0
i wanted to watch this movie part because i enjoyed the easy going humor in clueless and part because i like alicia silverstone as a young actress,0
i loved every gloriously insane moment,0
he had a smooth assured voice perfect for radio,0
now these men are not evil or wrong for they have done a great deal of good for wine,0
hugh grant was occupied to deliver his usual acting in his main character,0
generally speaking i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories,0
that this weird triangle works so well can be credited to the involved actors who do a good job,0
made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv,0
come to think of it that 's pretty much all that benjamin button is and if nothing else he knows more about death than just about anybody around,0
from there we see that after the surgery dawn is unable to speak or walk,0
it was momentarily amusing to see jeffrey combs but in the end he was pretty darn bad,0
lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear,0
haiku tunnel is similar to office space in that they are both films,0
it also kept him from being judgmental this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy,0
a real gem but keep it at arms length,0
not only that you can predict what 's going to happen at the end before you even hit the 30minute mark,0
that 's where this movie went terribly wrong,0
anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version,0
has awful written all over it,0
forget about any scares as it 's all rather inept cheap looking the last twenty odd minutes the exorcism itself is an eyesore of bad lighting camera angles,0
just like hey arnold and alot of these poorly drawn cartoons,0
i beg of you if you want to live a normal life do not buy not even rent this movie for if you do your eyes will sue for a capital lawsuit,0
where the book offered grisly discovery a search and a chase through the guys apartment the movie offers the backseat of the guys car,0
you would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about,0
the other major problem with the movie is the rather blah cast julianne moore glenn close o 'donnell that country singer and worst of all liv tyler,0
obviously nobody in cannes takes vinny seriously and it does n't even come to a facetoface meeting with mrs bates,0
it 's one thing for a movie to simply be bad,0
i was hoping to see more from him in this film,0
and stiggs articles in national lampoon,0
this type of economic phenomena sparked the concept of speed racer,0
i also love dario argento 's work from that period,0
i cried for 45 minutes straight,0
he too would leave warner brothers in two years for greener pastures,0
anyone know what 's up,0
the most credible was the 2001 bbc version,0
very disappointing in comparison with ros,0
this is a very intelligent movie that stirs pretty close to miller 's comics than anything of the past,0
anyway if you are curious about costa rican or central american movies this one will do but you are definitively not missing anything,0
in the end the way everyone on these boards and elsewhere rags on these kids lack of ability surely is more harmful to their selfimage than their parents forcing them into the spotlight,0
yes the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers,0
the formula does n't work,0
it keeps you really with it while it 's set in a small place with a lot of people having a big party so hard to shoot,0
it spins off other children 's shows and does n't bring anything further to the table,0
we know the events we do n't need to dwell on them again,0
but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start,0
the story of sweeney todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens and more contemporary writers like edward gory,0
its about the choices that we make and what are the consequences on our life and the impact toward us by the people we know,0
i believe the film is worthwhile as it informs the public about the dangers and capabilities of the criminal element,0
ok why complain about this movie,0
this should n't be in the comedy category it 's mostly drama,0
crazy like a fox is a deeply flawed film that nonetheless has its merits,0
i do n't regret spending around 80 minutes seeing it and i 've seen worse movies thats for sure,0
the film truly was a chaney picture from beginning to end,0
certainly sex comedies should be left to the americans who produce far funnier material in the american pies and porky 's of this world,0
then i thought maybe angela lansbury was only pretending to be drunk,0
there is very little graphic gore but there is a lot of blood splatter and kills that kept me interested through the entire movie,0
instead the audience has to watch a man who seems scared of his own shadow,0
the emphasis was on doing what men do the way men do in the workplace and in the bedroom,0
there is no comedy just a never ending pace as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous fast paced edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling,0
norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women,0
all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of molina 's best works and it 's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again,0
he opens up possibilities by giving her a switchblade,0
i put the blame here largely on a lacklustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action,0
the new cast with van der beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters eg,0
the nazis watch the girl burn out and you can see in their faces that they are drunk with power and reveling in their sadistic glory,0
knowing that the situation is out of his hands our dear harry heads over to south dakota to get the help of a real indian,0
a little sappy in some places but viva la love,0
perhaps i should talk about why i think this 90 min miracle of canadian cinema could have easily been condensed to a 10 min mediocre short film,0
like all the other reviews i believe its a shame he never went to hong kong to make films but at least people continue to give him credit,0
they tried to throw a curve by having the obvious suspect actually be guilty,0
there were a lot of scenes that involved the family,0
falk tries valiantly to breathe some life into this lumbering mess but arkin seems to be waiting for someone to tell him what to door at least to give him something funny to say,0
i suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than sir humphrey especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for mary towards the end,0
the fact that the 84 minutes preceding the real footage is bgrade quality adds to the realism,0
i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend,0
in this film short charlie brown invites all his friends for dinner,0
the worst segments were the one directed by wes craven the one with nick nolte the mime one the hair products one the one with juliette binoche the vampire one,0

the first time you notice that something is wrong is when we get our first closeup of our heroine,0
rating 7 out of 10 not rated,0
now it shows up again and the brother and the two hot chicks are gone and the whole thing revolves around the airline company,0
this movie is a joke,0
i'm not sure what the director thought about when he made this movie but i guess he thought that he could make about 100 scenes with people saying 23 lines then another 100 scenes of scenery,0
i'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches seinfeld knows is inaccurate,0
as it was i was left hungry,0
watching ll now you can almost picture the haze of pot smoke and lsd trips the creators and writers of this show must have gotten their ideas from,0
whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience,0
the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop,0
partly because of the situation itself and partly because you ca n't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this,0
not funny not moving just fake,0
the first 20 minutes or so are competent establishing the normally reliable premise of a curious stranger stumbling upon a paranoid hostile town,0
maybe that was my mistake,0
all the characters who were to be judged were n't nearly as likable or unlikable as they were in the remake and their final judgment seemed rather anticlimactic and dull,0
i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship,0
the bubbling of the water gives way to a small coffin that breaks the surface,0
it 's hard to praise this film much,0
as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture,0
the period covered is the cuban revolution from inception to completion with flashbacks of guevara addressing the un in 1964 though a large and largely wellacted ensemble film del toro dominates the screen,0
our salesman harbors a murderous obsession when the hard hitting all star falls into the worst slump in his career and the giants are feared to crumble along with him,0
the prostitute 's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud,0
amazing film but my only complain is that wendy had played a larger role in the story as she does in the book hence posting this review i found on internet as commentary,0
jezebel is n't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as gone with the wind and jezebel is a more light and less complicated one that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere not in the least also since gone with the wind is a movie in color of course,0
meiko kaji was a star of another dark comic turned movie sasori,0
the raven watched enraptured by his grand display of gallantry,0

walter connolly is laughable as the farmer 's father,0
in short i love this movie,0
i truly felt my iq lowering the longer i watched it,0
this show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games in that period,0
every room every description leads us deeper into a labyrinth and all the while the collector and the narrator engage in their separate monologues very occasionally verging into dialogue but mostly staying separate and different,0
you 'd expect her to be so pee 'd off at him now having let her be raped the entire night and sat idly by as a dozen men shoot at her but no she says she loves him and they kiss,0
4 nobody recognizes him his face is on every newspaper,0
also the louvre does not have steel gates that come down when a painting is removed from the wall,0
the movie 's collection did not meet the expected level,0
i agree with another post that drew fuller could have done a better job,0

in this scene the alien is not a gray alien so i will describe it,0
the movie is very inconsistent with its pace and disappoints immensely,0
grace worships the singer victor fox who will present a tv show in chicago and will give five spots on the first row in a tv promotion,0
really bad movies are typically renamed and this little disaster falls under that category,0
absolutely the very first film that scared me to death,0
frankly i had not heard of gary daniels until this flick,0
she goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats,0
a bored restless young woman in a dead end job in a small town hooks up with a smooth talking young man,0
the acting is particularly bad and while i'm not one of those who considers blair a bad actress i think in order to keep working she had to accept roles such as this,0

lady russell is too old,0
then some believe that they hear it but they do n't,0
after that hellish obstacle is fixed masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away,0
it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema,0
a suspicious looking man rents a room in an apartment from a family,0
apparently that 's the moral of this movie,0
shortly and frankly said this movie sucks it is not entertaining neither is it exciting nor is it worth watching,0
i have to mention that i watched the french version,0
hellman shoots for style while keeping his screen compositions simple,0
on the other hand sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man he grew up to be a man who realised that life is n't all about fun and games that death exists and able to take away his loved ones,0
women will be kidnapped men tricked old enemies battle with wits and electric shocks and a cast of satanic worshippers will gather by the end,0

how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain,0
how do films like this get made,0
i really would n't bother watching this total trash and an embarrassment to the british film industry,0
it was not a ferrari at all,0
if you have not yet seen this film please rent it i promise you 'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go unnoticed,0
the producers of this film apparently saw the matrix and a handful of vampire films and thought to themselves hey guys let 's take these ideas and then throw them in a blender with feces slap it in front of a camera and see what happens,0
i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly,0
without a screenplay without a director and without actors i do n't understand how can a film be made,0
close friends that 's what we need when we begin to be scared of life,0
things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation,0
i cannot stop saying how much i loved this movie,0
too bad this little gem was not seen by many in the theatres for it is truly a work of art,0
of course in the interests of forming a fair opinion i needed to see it out to the end,0
as far as good points there are none and therefore i gave this movie a 2 out of 10,0
by the way someone should tell the writer who seems to specialize in ruining classic fantasy written by women that grasp and last do n't rhyme,0
there is complexity of the story fish kills radiation and a sense that this is a larger problem that is lacking from most american films of the time period and the genre,0

basically the story goes like this,0
they did n't even show how anyone died,0
the host john newland had a very benign style all his own,0
especially enjoyable is the penultimate flashback sequence in which william remembers every rotten thing he 's ever done,0
what this film delivers for the astute fan of this genre is quite a hilarious romp via nordic flavor,0
not one of them believing they were true heroes the three are persuaded to separate their reluctance from the necessity to boost morale with the american public and ask for funds to continue with the necessary production of tanks grenades guns and armor,0
overall the film is a clear miss and an example of why sequels got such a bad name back in the eighties,0
he 's certainly earned it,0
van damme was on a role in the late eighties early nineties making some of the most fun simple action movies of the era,0
everyone else seemed like they were going through the actions that were given to them that minute and trying to remember what exactly they were doing,0
and in my opinion a much more human and emotional version,0
this film reminds me more of star 80 than a star is born,0
anyway worth checking out at least once,0
i have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the us government 's yearly demand for taxes,0
this is the particular genius of neil simon 's comedy it 's about situation and character,0
how did he get cast for that part,0
the two remaining crew members are tried for war crimes and sentenced to hang,0
perhaps my favorite character has to be jeff daniels who plays samir 's us contact,0
in many ways the truly heartbreaking story of louise beavers 's character 's love for her conflicted daughter is like something from a race picture,0
i guess market demand for inane game and reality shows on broadcast television a reflection on our sense of culture has conquered a good story,0
a sean connery lookalike plays spock 's halfbrother,0
instead i will appeal to you to save yourself wasting the time to even give this film a viewing you can never get that 30 minutes back,0
i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd 's i love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it 's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest,0
changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted,0
this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background,0

grand canyon written and directed by lawrence kasdan proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable aka the strange miraculous coincidence,0

the producers had brass balls i suppose but that 's hardly an admirable quality in this case,0
some of you on the website might not agree with me well i'm sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain do n't have too tolerate this crap but i do n't so it not my problem,0
the whole 'night of the living dead' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary,0
the readings are beautifully done,0
all in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience,0
but what if the wolf was a person in the modern world,0
when a person starts to explain something we are taken back to a scene we 've seen and are shown it again just to know what the conversation refers to,0

the mistress of spices had neither,0
when a young girl pro bush was ask if she see the fahrenheit 911 the answer was just great no,0
this movie was made in 1978 right after the release of star wars and a while after star trek,0
classic crap all the way,0
after the first viewing the images are burnt into your head the ending leaves you drained and broken and you will think about it for days,0
genius writing kris missed wow they almost rhyme must be a good lyric,0
then you 'll give a 10 to the first 8 to the second and 5 or 6 to the other,0
watch the movie and that will make sense,0
if you can get around the idea of how small people were exploited in many thirty flicks this movie has some enjoyable moments,0
after this he has seven more scenes without his shirt including one in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electricity a la mel gibson in lethal weapon,0
with all traces of character removed from the role leaving him with nothing to work with it 's not until the last couple of reels that he actually becomes a remotely credible character instead of a poorly drawn walking religious icon hey look everybody i'm suffering for your sins just like christ,0
it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits but overall it is n't a bad film,0
peter falk gives the performance of his life,0
if with a friend like harry occupies a prominent place in my favorite movies made in 2000 lemming has a prime place in the category of the dashed hopes of 2005 if you are a david lynch buff this one has your name on it and for the others caution,0
this is the only film i know of which deals with angst over what must be a common enough fact of life among gay men and lesbians that one of their parents is also gay,0
with me because no one i knew was a fan of either of the bands,0
it is not overacted and the characters are for real,0
they were like puppets rejected from sesame street for looking too unfriendly,0
although the acting and the production values are n't bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing,0
also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help,0
a great film this and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on channel four,0
just like society the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could move on to their next tragic opera,0
i love this movie it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we 've been friends for 25 years and saw it together,0
i recommend this dvd to everyone i talk with about purchasing dvd 's,0
though many audiences will have a problem with northfork 's lack of traditional dramatic structure stick with it jack,0
this game adds nothing new in terms of gameplay or even cinematics,0
the novel is turned into a fantasy adventure in this film with all the treasures and monsters,0
the jokes were a bit more adult like in my opinion and its obvious they were aiming it at both kids and adults alike,0
there was a story somewhere in there about saving a foster home for some kids but it just served to move the rest of the story along,0
i usually like will ferrell but here he just never clicked for me,0
i had already purchased it based off of all the fanatical comments on imdb and i certainly was n't going to let it collect dust after spending my hardearned money,0

the caf scenes work best with the handheld cams to show what it 's really like in there,0
i do n't think that this movie had to be dr strangelove or 2001 both of which it presages but it had potential never realized,0
about half way through we turned it off,0
it 's a typically cool classy performance by mr daniell but his confrontations with holmes seem to be a tedious bore to him,0
and cypher follows similar patterns,0
in my opinion dennis hopper has always been a unidimensional performer so i was n't expecting much from him and he delivered,0
i'm putting it on ebay this weekend,0
starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie,0
worse than all dean cain films combined,0
do they intend for their homegrown movies to be so cheap so silly so patently obvious in what passes for plot,0

i mean if you 've watched more than two or three movies about wwii then you 'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot,0
pretty good special effects for a very low budget scifi tv,0
probably something jeffrey dahmer said at some point,0
as an avid fan of fantasy and adventure i had extremely high hopes for kull,0
frankenheimer puts on a great show,0
this only just manages to slot into the slasher category which is due to the brief appearance of a mystery killer in a bright yellow rain coat,0
and who is this awesome woman carla gugino,0
as soon as i heard the score i said to myself that it sounded very familiar,0
like his earlier bowling for columbine the film is very much a set up especially in the second half where moore 's antics or at least his camera crew and presence result in some staged scenesthe whole cuba thing,0
we expect very little from a seagal movie especially recent ones,0
some women do go a little crazy when it comes to their wedding day,0
a bedroom scene between alice and ted is played with pitchperfect comedic timing and showcases both actor 's ability to balance seriousness and lunacy,0
so where does this leave bud,0
let me tell you that title fits this movie,0
it 's one of the best movies that i have seen this year,0
the movie starts with a closeup on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books,0
especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly has n't got a clue what all the medical terms mean,0
that 's deeper than mencia would ever dare to dive,0
it 's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a family comedy,0
probably my least favorite demi moore movie,0
franco nero as always delivers a superb performance and jack palance gives a very good performance as a very unpleasant killer,0
the story is rather odd and simple and above all extremely original,0
that 's a good thing because this movie was bad on a long leash,0
for all of the magnificent scientific marvels that were embodied in the invention of the giant metal robots the mad scientist is concerned only in looting bank vaults pillaging jewelry establishments and repelling attacks from tommy gun wielding uniformed coppers,0
i 've never understood the attraction to jean harlow and gable is absolutely awful in this,0
i urge you to watch this film at least once big arn has come along way,0
in fact i 'd be happy to see the show last for a full season,0
that 's because the actors are seemingly real people,0
most of the characters remain unexplained,0
a film that is both cynical and optimistic,0
the films of the science fiction channel have become boringly predictable,0
it 's not that i would mind a good movie about relationships,0
for the sake of the brain cells you will lose watching this not to mention the precious hour and a half of your life you will lose leave this stinkbomb on the shelf of your local video store until they decide to send it off to the video limbo it so richly deserves,0
amos poe has some kind of alt street cred although now i ca n't remember for what,0
then there are the two aliens both look alike but their personalities differ,0
forbidden planet remains probably my favorite scifi film ever and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen,0
harry carey wins over most of the people there with several acts of kindness and charity,0
their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality,0
the one thing that really got on my nerves bad was the fact that logos on shirts were blurred out and since a good deal of the cast wears a jersey during the first half of the film this became extremely distracting and almost made the film unwatchable,0
it does n't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move,0
i guess some of the special effects were good but that 's about it,0
in this case it follows the exploitation of foreign workers who came to england in desperate search of work and the lengths they will go earn money,0
i wonder how popular these films were although apparently they were n't popular enough because baum 's production company was short lived,0
personally i have no problem with the acting nor the script,0
there 's a silent film studio that specializes in personal exposition infomercials,0
i would like to think that of mice and men was his favorite role,0
probably eastwood has never done a better job than he does here and it is all so effortless for the old pro,0
a few interesting shots aside the director tries far too hard with far too little success awkward tracking shots and jittery camerawork distracting from what little element of story there is,0
i knew nothing of the film before i saw it and i really did hope for something enjoyable enlightening what have you but i was disappointed,0
the acting is wooden the effects are crap and the set is a couple off rooms used over and over again,0
do n't waste your time money or anything at all on this piece of film,0
when i finally decided to watch laurel canyon i thought that this would be a good movie,0
i 'll give this one 3 out of 5,0
the steady increase of fear in the militia is palpable,0
miike probably made his most serious film to date with this film,0
well this film does n't have a good story and i was really disappointed with it,0
the effects were cheesy it was painfully slow and worst of all roy thinnes has a total of about ten minutes screentime across the first part and then vanishes,0
matthau 's charlie has just been widowed before the film began,0
if my movie would have been slightly better it would have been a bigger classic than village of the damned which has a similar theme and got released two years later,0
it 's a different movie as you all know,0
like she always says that 's hot,0
tony leung literally wipes his face down with a towel every few moments for almost the entire film,0
there is really only one scene that could actually be worth seeing again and that is the shootout in the beginning,0
some decent effects do n't hurt the film but the movie just is n't entertaining,0
only girls she says cheerfully,0
i think the show was canceled to early only 18 episodes,0
the dvds of the episodes are provided weekly with a greek newspaper in greece,0
she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft but she is pretty hot too,0
costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here,0
we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath,0
i can say that where the davinci code painted catholicism as a shady coverup group of sadists angels and demons paints them with a much lighter brush,0
he did one at christmas to try and bring back a number one song and now the terrific justin lee collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite tv shows as a kid the ateam,0
you really connect with these characters,0
this move is loved by many types of people men and women young and old alike,0
amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies,0
as a matter of fact as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort,0
i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and whatnot,0
he is just able to touch her drink before time begins to reverse and it goes back to her giving him the money,0
aside from the aesthetically pleasing aspects of the movie i actually did n't know who the killer was right up until the end,0
i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role,0
what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance,0
this is why i watch independent film,0
it is the kind of film where a couple sees a bashed in door and the girl dismisses it by saying oh my mom must have forgotten her keys,0
an extremely gentle retelling of the shakespeare play,0
it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets are terribly well done,0
exactly what you 'd expect from an hk comedy,0
another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture,0
so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies this is the one for you,0
here this turkey is greeted as a hero by one and all and taken into the castle of the king,0
absolutely never ever had as little a shy smile on my face there just are n't any jokes worth laughing about in this movie,0
the difference here is that madhuri the lead actor does n't end up with a romance at the end,0
feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other,0
i specifically made an account to comment on this film of how horribly written this was,0
after the exhilarating opening scene enduring love becomes a strange mixture of claude chabrol and adrian lyne not that its strangeness is something negative it just seems this is a film with many tricks up its sleeve but without a coherent directorial identity,0
this film by existentialist director monte hellman who later helped produce quentin tarantino 's seminal reservoir dogs is an important one,0
ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite,0
this style also means the twists are much more effective,0
the story is that of two friends joyce and cynthia who find they have to cover up a killing but fall apart as the investigation closes in on them,0
this has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made and that 's saying something,0
her character is fleshed out in a way none of the others are,0
but i do not claim him to be a bad director this time,0
the movie involved me emotionally and even if i did not like the ending it was a pretty good movie,0
1 why would the us government blow up the third building with bombs hours after the attack,0
but i 've kinda always had this philosophy acting does n't matter if you have special effects,0
the boy resides with his father who is recovering from alcoholism and fails to be of support for his troubled son,0
he brought a depth to his character,0
you ca n't help but wonder how movies like this ever get made,0
that 's the only complaint i have,0
the pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it 's there,0
for some easy money he and his horse hidalgo enter buffalo bill 's roadshow,0
not that its not wrapped in a nice bow but it makes some points for equality,0
her 5yearold son was depressed and stepped off a building to his death years earlier,0
typical americans in a foreign country storyline made better by the talents of the lead actors,0
since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere you wonder why it was n't also cut to reduce the boredom factor,0
if you decided to read this far you still might want to watch to see how severe a phobia can be and an extreme example of how love for a family member can possibly cure it,0
of these only cry hit 's the mark being exactly the type of song johnny ray would 've sung and this provides the sole amusing scene in the film when a slightly drunk buchanan decides to have a crack,0
it takes an artist of beatty 's caliber to turns things around and makes us laugh and shiver at this mess of our own making,0
i can understand why chow 's movies did n't get popular outside of asia until the brilliant shaolin soccer,0
that willingness to endure pain clearly survives today not the desire to create it in others and that 's the only point i would have added to this wonderful film,0
he may very well be but i ca n't see this film as an insult to homosexuals,0
the film is ugly lacking in real atmosphere and just so damned slow,0
remember those days when your grandma or mom tells you a story about fairy world,0
and i mean for a good long while,0
maybe they found ray liotta 's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary,0
especially in films such as this believability is critical,0
the action is top notch,0
i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy,0
the only problem is her old boyfriend billy who 's pretty much a psychopath,0
and it was all produced by magic johnson,0
i have heard that this movie came before the blair witch project which i thought was excellent and that it may have inspired the blair witch project,0
this film shows why he and charlie mccarthy were so popular,0
i watched this show once in mid 90s on discovery because i saw connections before this and liked burke as the narrator,0
it looks like anyone can make a film these days so grab your friends any object that has a camera and get to work,0
okay no one was blown away by his acting ability but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy,0
made it seem more real,0
and last but not the least the climatic action scene at the hospital that lasts for over a halfhour and it displays a long continued shot that lasts for almost 3 minutes,0
even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with the other man because i must do it to survive,0
in the old days i watched it on black and white on tv and its magic to see it in colour,0
this movie all in all was boring,0
this is a great movie with some absolutely hilarious clips,0
though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror there was a distinct lack of blood,0
what was it spent on,0
if done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it,0
the second part of the film concerns stanwyck being assigned as a private night nurse to some kids who are being slowly starved to death,0
the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire because so many questions can be asked of them,0
do n't waste your time watching this even if you 're a jeff speakman fan,0
i do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case i am sure that it will get few oscar nominations,0
keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact,0
just like he must have cared more for animals at one point,0
this film is not considered to be within the top 100 films of all time,0
still despite a few minor faults jodhaa akbar is a remarkable dramatic and brilliant film with a rare beauty and powerful sense of ambition,0
outsourced is a great film,0
there is also a neat flashback sequence with footage shot for the first film but not seen before,0
what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to wish or hate away,0
i do n't remember the original movie so i ca n't say if it 's better or worse,0
although she is ordered to go by bus to philadelphia she wants to stick around the place she was arrested,0
his 16 films with moe and larry marked the nadir for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to watch,0
her typical role is as a woman looking for love,0
a baby plus many more twists and turns to follow,0
read the book it 's a fabulous story which loses it 's impact on screen,0
i loved it whenever he 's talking to her dad and he says are you telling me i 've only known this girl two days and already i care more about her than you do,0
she 's the quintessential good girl to counterpoint the seductive manipulations of aura the quintessential bad girl,0
story is that of two men one a buddhist monk with magical powers and the other a highly skilled samurai warrior with an indestructible sword,0
to michael pare just as the 747 comes in sight,0
carrie preston 's sally owes more to ellen greene in the little shop of horrors,0
for me it was the passion that eric bogosian put into his performance,0
he tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was,0
or if you got the tickets free,0
i bet the scenes inspired tripe like harry potter,0
either people are hurting each other or they 're crying in this film,0
this movie fails on so many levels,0
i 've seen riverdance in person and nothing compares to the video but the show is awesome,0
however when i saw that the movie had fred williamson and robert forster i just had to watch the film,0
i simply can find no fault with any of the cast writers or director,0
the rest of the cast seems way over the top,0
however these compensations are not enough to make it a worthwhile movie even for fans of the giallo genre,0
it contains fabulous historical footage which reminds us of why we moved to the suburbs in the first place,0
it fails at that by being just plain blatant,0
you can see and hear her for yourself,0
the notorious bettie page is a bland case history fit for a freshman college feminism course,0
if on the other hand this style of humor is not what you enjoy it may not be the one for you,0
it is not even worth the 99 cents i paid to rent the dvd,0
but gossip is n't all bad either,0
they have to put aside their own overwhelming grief and fears and prepare ben to face his approaching death with the same love and courage with which they had been preparing him for life,0
okay if you 're a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe,0
i was kept rapt by the action because i wanted to find out how each character would respond to each situation presented and in every case it was so natural and easy and most important of all believable that it was gratifying to watch,0
i think it 's one of her better roles as she does remarkably well with this made for cinemax movie,0
angelina jolie however had won an academy award so that 's where the money was,0
it 's all just so cute all even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave,0
ca n't recommend it enough,0
the beauty of that adaptation is beyond description,0
however with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused,0
the plot just barely dodges being called corny,0
it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started,0
the second half was pretty bad,0
also features the the godlike ability of christopher nolan to write perfect dialogue,0
this was an absolutely horrible movie,0
he was not content however to turn out the sort of product that his publishers wanted and that surely would have sold,0
if you a big fan of the author 's body of work you may as a completist make an extra effort to enjoy this but aside from two or three memorable moments such as the conclusion things are rather flat,0
the acting seems to suffer as the hunk just is n't believable in some key scenes,0
easily the best of the directtovideo sequels,0
this guy is supposed to spiritual,0
or were you sleeping and just caught bits and pieces,0
while they tried to act like americans and the film was supposed to be in california the accents are strong,0
there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls,0
more attitude and even more confidence,0

the dialog also restrain the actors and situations from being funny,0
dum duh dumb dumb i'm still stammering to figure out what the purpose was to even spend the time to write this story,0
so all i could said is that this is one of the best animated series from one of my favorite animation studios rankinbass with plenty of fantasy adventure humor and beautiful animation i loved it,0
forty years ago as a very young man i found this film fascinating too,0
sigh some will do anything and everything to make a name for themselves,0
the only funny character were delores,0
also the movie has a vaguely homophobic feel to it and the grainy film stock really got on my nerves,0
much of the genius of this movie is that it breaks the horrormovie visual mold and floods it with light creating a fascinating tension between plot and setting,0
astaire and rogers had been such a success in flying down to rio that today the true stars of the film are almost forgotten and they also shone in the gay divorce,0
i can assure you however that this thing has absolutely nothing to do with freaks or even with the art of professional filmmaking in general,0
i'm trying to be objective for the record,0
each of the major plot lines has its own musical theme ranging from pop goes the weasel to the love theme from romeo and juliet,0

i am so glad dave started playing these as i had only seen the us version and clips on youtube until then,0
i would agree with him on both accounts,0
but the puppets themselves are the real stars,0
this film may be nothing more than a paean to muscular soviet man but it is very well done,0
i am already a devoted fan notwithstanding that the film i had so much wanted to watch kept eluding me,0
the movie does n't rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering,0
for instance there 's a guy who lives with the vampires and he wants so bad to be a vampire,0
i just saw this on hbo in the us tonight,0
everything about this movie was horrible,0
the living and the dead tries to pass itself off as a film like memento or the usual suspects but it comes off as something that disappoints the viewer in the end,0
please explain it to me,0

and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one,0
but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs,0
i suppose he would say blues gives healthy expression to both without unleashing either,0
i 've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more,0
and do n't use low budget as an excuse i have seen many great lowbudget films in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were lowbudget,0
i need to speak with the person responsible for this,0
sound the trumpets a star has arrived,0
it was based more on how upperclass white people heavily depended on the cheap work of illegal immigrants,0
prison life too is much like that,0

the bad guys have stolen a killer virus and are intending to let it loose to make a fortune selling the antidote,0

if what happens before his flight seems outlandish once he is on the jet he spends his time in the cargo hold with two fluffy dogs named scrappy and coco,0
the next book is exodus which the movie the ten commandments was based on,0
this is one of the funniest movies i 've ever saw,0
the whole scene is filler as every clue that is revealed is just not important enough to justify this travesty,0
but the acting and atmosphere more than makes up for the fact i all ready knew most of what would happen in the movie,0
in this case we have a serial killer who is out for american blood,0
you 'll probably like it,0
the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they could n't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit,0
but these daydream episodes did n't happen again and i was pretty happy with the following results,0
i would so not recommend this film,0
in her 22 years of life she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids,0
the different obstacles and moves were just difficult enough to where i could n't overcome them the first time around but they were n't so difficult that i had to give up,0
they go out and work together in helping each other out,0
beneath the surface it appears lies some pretty heavy symbolism,0
it failed to grab my interest on any level,0
unfortunately for me this was not a new classic of horror that some people hail it as it 's a disjointed mess that 's light on scares originality and fun,0
for others the film will probably open up a window into the experience and for still others many scenes may provoke disgust and revulsion,0
i could n't believe her last interview it seemed like she had lost her mind,0
no we 've got to leave,0
it is somewhat an allegorical film in the way some religiously derived films intend to be,0
bogged down by an uninspiring direction you 've been warned,0
it has this way too slick shotonvideo look,0
i had not heard of this film and had no idea what to expect from it but when i saw it i was overwhelmed,0
this was n't even bad enough to become cult,0
i acknowledge that it was directtovideo,0

if you just want a good time you should check this out,0
all very relevant today 70 plus years later,0
it 's not your typical well anything,0
this new galactica is a huge disappointment,0
the film picks its villains well,0
sure it has some loopholes and the unnecessary collateral damage but watch this for the performance all round and an engaging storyline that might not keep you guessing all the way once the cat is out of the bag but does enough,0
this is n't exactly a complicated story,0
these flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene,0
seeing that he cannot as well roma goes to ask for help,0
but they always fail in one after another way in a funny way but different ways,0

there are other characters that you learn to enjoy but the friendships between these women is stronger than anything thrown at them including man troubles,0

a funny movie i love planes and i 've seen it more than 3 times,0

the acting is torpid at best kiefer sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of jack bauer and michael douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving catherine zetajones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey,0
it 's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too so it 's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best scifi motion pictures i 've ever seen,0
the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die,0
usually one can at least learn something from a genuinely bad movie but with this one for the very first time i wanted to go back to my film rental store and demand my 350 back on general principles,0
the really terribly bad horror film,0
what a disappointment and supreme embarrassment,0
the only thing that is decent with this movie is the soundtrack maybe,0
before we go and continue to bash the hell out of it again people need to come back and take a look around themselves and watch natural born killers,0

vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he 's just had his lines by heart,0
beyond that there is also the question of whether humanity itself now saddles itself with unjust laws and punishments which do not fit the crime,0
describing the dialogue as horrendous would be accurate and perhaps a little soft,0
the sadness was explained up front in the beginning and wrap up with follow up paragraphs,0
what a steaming pile this is,0
the thing is there probably is a real story here but the translation just does n't work in this film,0
thus the books carry with them an agenda not so much to get the lost to understand their need for christ but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible,0
i like how the 50 's movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one,0
this movie reminds me of harry potter not the style but the marketing strategy,0
still the movie works as a light romantic fantasy,0
volcanic eruptions are not rare events but the eruption in north america of a volcano generally regarded by the public as extinct attracted enormous public attention as events unfolded day by day,0
but here 's the trick this is n't something hollywood contrived and it is n't trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport,0
when the movie ended i rushed to the computer to check historic facts and was amazed that the movie was so factual with the exclusion of the tyrone power part,0
the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop,0
the fanny in this adaptation is too meek and subservient with hardly a thought of her own until near the end of the series,0
i mean it 's not titled the jerk 2 it 's the jerk too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different person,0
why could n't it get a happy ending,0
in my mind this film is one of the first great adventure films of the 20th century,0
he did n't overplay the role and i found him to be totally believable,0
absolutely awful i have never seen such and obvious attempt at a directorial get out of jail card,0
there 's also a pretty disposable appearance by carol burnett as a hooker,0
in general it 's a movie which puts tribute to all the kung fu movie,0
bride of the gorilla is similar to the aforementioned the wolf man in story and atmosphere but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful,0
her job he feels is too exciting and important and will threaten their marriage,0
long scenes of virtually nothing happening are presented as apparently the director 's idea of suspense characters whine and fight with each other and sort of act scared but for some reason never all just decide to group together and leave the place,0
taking cash from many countries and in return each country has to get a reward somehow,0
a classic in its genre,0
this is one of the most underrated movies of the 1990s,0
and together with the visual effects confident cinematography clever use of editing music and sound and disarming performances it becomes magical,0
it is very wellacted but the script and direction ramble all over the place,0
also the fact i do n't own too many foreign films and this is a first,0
adding insult to injury surprise simply retold the same story as hello love but without the wit or pathos,0
give it a chance and take it for what it is,0
with the same budget and time space a decent movie of it could have been made,0
jackie in a rare film appearance makes a perfect sub for rodney really look at the little things,0
so i give the movie an 8 out of 10 the subsequent television series was n't as good,0
the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them,0
our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world 's three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence,0
but their problems have only begun,0
welles' film is too personal with an interesting twist towards totalitarianism the 1990 or so tv version is too shallow,0
i 'll try to finish with a few positive aspects like for example it stars ken foree,0
it did not open the doors to my imagination,0
poor shelley stuck in this bad movie,0
the plot is original yet simple,0
this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced,0
in most cases the films had almost no plot and degenerated to people punching and kicking each other,0
pure '80 fun and this movie is what 's so great about america,0
this was truly a deeply moving movie in every sense of the word,0
thing is i'm a john travolta fan,0
i mean if an actor is on stage he should speak as clear as possible,0
he learns to speak later in the film it is very good for a guy like him,0
this has got to be one of if not the unfunniest show on tv right now,0
neil takes wendy 's hand,0
i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release,0
five minutes later a nuclear strike warning in my town could n't have torn me away from the screen and it 's been watched a dozen times since,0
it is entirely symbolic everything in it has a figurative meaning,0
well it certainly stunned me i can not believe that someone made another australian film that 's even more boring than somersault,0
two sequels followed the first of which magnum force tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences,0
frankly i do not know how lost in translation screenplay appealed to scarlett and bill murray,0
it is a wonderful little film and i can recommend it,0
characters are really fun especially the priest,0
despite taking place in an area that seems wide open the story pretty much takes place in either the woods or the aztec village for 95 of the time so it is n't visually exciting either,0
which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters,0
the scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie,0
cartoons are iconic incomplete images that require the viewer to use their imagination,0
by the way that big snake would be considered a monster,0
the strength of one true thing lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above hollywood clich territory,0
in one of the scenes they show vampires as being invisible in the mirror and then they show the joker 's reflection after he turns into a vampire,0
this is a film for everyone we all know these people and it 's interesting to see how a single interest can connect such different people,0
do n't see this movie there 's a real chance you 'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again ever,0
go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote,0
and he does it in such a clumsy way with lines like did ya hear that baby,0
while watching another indie horror flick i 'd made up my mind that i need to start reviewing indies as a separate entity from hollywood films they simply ca n't compare,0
the movie does share some beautiful scenery which is ruined by dumb dialog riddled with clich and a camera that is apparently attached to the back of a turtle when not in the hands of a rampaging squirrel,0
thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception bmovie,0
it is supposed to make you feel something,0
there is virtually no buildup of tension the music is boring and the dubbing of the kid is annoying,0
the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it,0
they follow the terrorists to an island with raptors,0
i remember thinking to myself this is the most intelligently done scifi movie i 've seen in a while,0
this is one of the best columbo episodes ever,0
nothing new probably not ridiculous enough for most but a better than average revenge thriller,0
this is clearly not a character drama but we should get something,0
just forget about this movie and try your best to avoid it,0
overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards,0
no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type,0
actually we do n't but boy is this film an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible hoot of a stinker,0
if you decide to see this film be certain to focus your attention on the brief opening sequence,0
manipulative drama about a glamorous model who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister whose music teacher he is,0
pursued is a very decent picture very nicely shot darkly imaginative and dripping with noir style but if it 's actually a noir film then that really is up for debate as is if this film really is a western,0
benton comes nowhere close to the subtle nailbiting tension hitch provided in his heyday,0
she does n't even need to speak and you just see the range of emotions she 's going through,0
heading the cast is angus macfadyen as a sensitive young man who is well adjusted with his lifestyle and who can express himself intelligently and carry himself with dignity,0
hindsight now tells me i should have waited for the video a few years from now and saved a few bucks,0
she 's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in rocky iv and cobra,0
it was just as awful if not worse than what i expected,0
and at the end not disappointed,0
looked an original nri kid,0
half of africa 's been explored on rumor hope legend and blood the same could be said of the film industry,0
i would even say that this is worse than viva laughlin,0
i love the anime version,0
did n't the end clinch it at least,0
ca n't he just use his gun,0
i had such a disinterest in it that i did n't even want to be bothered by hitting the pause button,0
it 's also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps,0
even if you 've seen it fifty times it 'll still be more exciting,0
also kurtz was n't even on the steamboat when he died which especially made the entire journey even more futile which just got annoying after a while,0
surprisingly death on the nile was only nominated for one academy award of which it won,0
to its credit this would be a pretty good plot for a porno film,0
saying the whole portions of this movie are unwatchable is untrue bc that would imply that some parts of the movie are,0
here 's what i think happened every time one of the actors made an attempt at acting that actor was beaten until they learned to stand there remembering lines instead of actually acting,0
the main problem with the film stems from the plotting,0
some spoilers american desi is an amateur production which is not nuanced comical or even close to the reality it pokes fun at,0
the third man tells an interestingly bleak story set in a bleak desolate urban environment rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal bw cinematography,0
i was one person to play marley 's ghost and christmas future,0
but neither the astronaut nor the ship resemble either of them actually used in the film one could only hope,0
but then again she did n't actually physically do that much a broken character that the movie cuts off good intentions but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are,0
call it too extreme for the mainstream crowd,0
it is such an amazingly bad story that they had to use close to 20 plot twists to try to fool the audience that it would hold up,0
i 'll just copy that',0
the acting if it can be called that is an abomination,0
final word of caution watch at your own peril,0
woody invites his family to celebrate thanksgiving with his family and mitch longing for a true family celebration is game and drags his reluctant family along with him,0
freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang,0
a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister,0
de toth operated in most genres and whether adopting monochrome or color stock the fullframe ratio or the widescreen he could always be depended upon to deliver an efficient unpretentious stylish and entertaining product,0
well i have literally just got back from watching this movie and while i wouldnt say it was awful i wouldnt put it up there with lord of the rings or any other great films,0
the movie ends with voiceovers still pictures and rehashed footage,0
buy it rent it watch it,0
i do n't get it and i do n't support it and you should never waste your time watching this show unless you like it when your eyes bleed from their sockets,0
suddenly a new person appears and there 's no data on him,0
as andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them i really did feel for him like i say because i would find it incredibly hard to live if i was like that,0
trust me pass this piece of crap up,0
it is n't just the nature of the characters but also how they talk,0
she 's worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping potion god stop whining,0
so things are all entwined and make no sense,0
despite the fact that the original is a far superior film this one at least tried to be at the same level in many ways even if this aim was n't fully achieved,0
he 's never been that great throughout his career but he has every once in awhile he 's had a pretty good leading supporting role and this was unfortunately one of his duds,0
a great if underrated 1970s cop drama,0
they need to just stick to rapping,0
as scifi goes the superior ones focus more on futuristic andor scientific concepts with action andor special effects adding to the spectacle,0

levy is mildly funny but a little of him goes a long way as he has proved in everyone of his movies,0
it makes me want to follow my dreams and follow my heart so see the movie you 'll see dancing romancing financing fencing crowd scenes chase scenes this is the motion picture with everything it 's even got the kitchen sink,0
and to say the least i'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie i can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring,0
the issues of the 60 's are brought to light here but it 's all over the place beginning with new year 's eve 1963 then three minutes later it 's new year 's eve 1964 then three minutes later it 's new year 's eve 1965 then three minutes later it 's back to 1963 again,0

and by the way the deaths are repeating like 247,0
he calls this one of the most bizarre films,0
and since no one seems to care about them and their welfare why should they return the favor,0
the latter half of the movie is an irredeemable catastrophe as if even the editor gave up on this movie after the midpoint,0

comes this sound effect that sounds like someone punching a stale wooden box,0

well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour that is a safe comparison,0
i do recommend this movie but wait for the videodvd,0
some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouse 's british sense of humour,0
as a filmmaker i find watching bad stuff like this to be a learning experience of what not to do in a movie,0
dolph looks good too and of course there is lots of fights and things too so he was happy,0
the nuns naked or seminaked emerge from their cell doors and begin to follow the priest and well i think it 's not necessary to tell more,0
basically it 's a cool funny very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of if you work hard enough and wait patiently you 'll get what you want even if it was n't what you intended,0
i enjoyed every minute of this film whose score and choice of background and especially credit music made it all that much more memorable,0
and here 's why you may feel it is an effort,0
this is the kind of crap that appeals to the oprah crowd,0
stephen chow is definitely putting china on the world cinema map with his genre of movies,0
the previews were so funny that i could n't wait to see this movie,0
really date movie does n't deserve the attention it 's getting from me writing this review,0
this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons,0
and the soundtrack to this movie has some very valuable jewels you might want to check out,0
i give it two thumbs up,0
and this is the main problem,0
john wayne does well in an early role as the assistant in the file office though all the supporting players are quite good,0
the ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable,0
is it the historical inaccuracies,0
her character in the book is sexually beaten up by the young stud which would never do for the legendary ms west,0
i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being sickly sweet and overly slushy,0
my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can get the bad guy with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean and also the language is pretty clean in your movies but this one is something else,0
like someone already said we never figure out why he wants to die,0
most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events,0
and i liked the music,0
apart from that i had an awful time,0
the second scene when we see on the background a sort of openair brothel with prostitutes taking their customers behind tents and so on,0
a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red,0
this aside i think this film is exquisitely shot,0
during one of the murder scenes the director intercuts a game of soccer going on outside,0
the next impressive setpiece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet,0
henry june seems to stop itself short of being purely a sexual film or a drama,0
i think this last reason is the most compelling reason that bush went to war whether he realizes it or not he wanted to win not so much the war on terror but the next election,0
sanjay was excellent as the tortured father,0
i was expecting the film to be funnier a black comedy when really you see the melodramatic overtones of human drama and a positive film,0
luckily it was a free rental with a top twenty rental,0
not sure hard to tell really,0
the first time i watched this movie i thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way i do n't know maybe this just is n't my type of humor,0
the past are presented in an almost palatable tone which make them all the more unsettling,0
normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you 've found out they 're just misunderstood or they 've been freed or whatever,0
the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat,0
one scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without nipples,0
instead they are starving and robbing peter to pay paul,0
numerous scenes in this dragged on effortlessly while the end was a complete ripoff of identity and high tension,0
i have to stress that this is not entertainment more like a high school diversity lesson call it the blood on the highway of racism,0
a group of party animals led by the alternative angela goes to celebrate halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries an eerie urban legend,0
it just never grabbed me or made me know what i was watching,0
the dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times but that is part of the effect cronenberg was going for to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease,0
haunting and beautiful this is a story as unique as the imagination of the viewer,0
she inhabits a very public and very familiar setting in an underground tube train but shuns attention and dismisses claims from one passenger she is the successful author she is accused of being,0
she sees life as we all should for all it 's beauty,0
offenders are magically tracked even if they were to escape to africa or at times confined in siberia,0
instead the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide but never do,0
the dvd cover features a quip from kevin smith but do n't be fooled,0
i must say that i am often a fan of films in which very little of any consequence occurs,0
add to this the truly magnificent acting and it 's easy to understand why this movie is so famous,0
a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out,0
people share their random thoughts as they walk through their lives chat at coffee shops and preach on street corners,0
that 's not experimental that 's crap,0
when this movie was made i was n't even born,0
i do n't want to spoil it for anyone but you wo n't like it either unless you are sadistic,0
being an italian low profile production it managed to be suspenseful and interesting,0
i have no idea why they decided to change the music for the dvd release but the film was much cooler with the original soundtrack,0
the house 's blind matriarch 's husband had an affair with the dead woman who was the matriarch 's son 's fiancee,0
character gives a knowing look which the audience will not even remotely understand,0
crawford and lionel barrymore not only make their clichd lines and characters wholly believable they literally walk off into the sunrise together at the end as clichs often do,0
definitely one of the best crime thrillers of the past decade,0
i did n't watch the bm show till just recently now that it 's in reruns and i love it,0
but having heard great things i decided to watch it on british tv,0
that just broke my heart but other than that i liked this movie a lot,0
but this was just plain bad,0
but then he decides to show up,0
i thought it was a very funny movie,0
my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space,0
however there is one aspect that completely saved this film for me the extras,0
the circular direction reappears in the later fight between brown and mr smith and it is effective,0
pixote is the one of most powerful shocking and moving motion picture to come from brazil,0
it 's a clich for internet nerds to say god i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving well this is exactly how i felt even in the middle of the action scenes,0
in one disturbing scene in particular the lovely young lady joins in his laughter innocently never realizing why he is laughing,0
and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in,0
that often are rotted in real science,0
she was obviously created to be the 'perfect' character as i said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them in most of the episodes she creates a problem then has to fix it,0
that this first part of theo angelopoulos' trilogy is an indisputable masterpiece is a fact that speaks for itself,0
it has some events that seem forced and unlikely like when cal and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place,0
no other action movie comes close to this,0
they want to parody the bollywood tearjerker and still cater to the section of audience that wants to believe it to be real,0
bullshit author and victim returns home and learns things about him self and makes teacher see the error of his ways sounds like a good serious movie,0
hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set,0
nor are we certain when the bombs will go off so we do n't even have a classic ticking bomb tension sequence,0
actually there 's another crime scene investigation almost as funny as the first defoe gets so worked up that he sweats tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air at a crime scene,0
ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable,0
it is not your typical suspense movie but a movie well packed with interesting twists and surprises which leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel,0
any questions or comments please feel free to reply,0
i certainly do n't get it,0
talk about preying on anyone 's worst fears,0
low budget meets lower budget with high laugh content,0
yet they 've transferred the fantasy from the book very well and that made it worth a look for me,0
this is a great horror film,0
the boy is no fool but starts by feeling an alliance with the man,0
i 've been a fan of horror for decades,0
this show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family,0
and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time chungking express is alright but it 's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like crouching tiger,0
president bush has argued publicly that both sides should be taught in school,0
it would be like calling austin powers 'an american guy goes to the movies',0
after the disappointment of mr moto 's gamble i went into mr moto takes a vacation hoping for the best but admittedly fearing the worst,0
to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s,0
many users have given the film rave reviews for its story its look and it philosophical script,0
nor does he seem to notice this difference,0
everything is terrible about this movie,0
confusing joan barclay future lone ranger clayton moore along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that looks as if filmmakers were making it up as they went along,0
but i am so happy that i now know the name of it,0
i was really hoping to be touched by this film but was n't,0
hill street blues would manage to make fun of people like this with a character on the show stating pretty much the same thing saying they were torn up for 24 days over the viet nam war telling this to a vet,0
lewis milestone 's direction is another plus,0
very little time was spent on dan 's actual journey,0
oh well there are also displays of horrible acting fx and dialogues,0
that said i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor,0
i thought the kids in the movie were great,0
the characters are all onedimensional morons with loud exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard,0
director barry levinson would have done well to heed the old line that if you are going to go up to the bell ring it,0
i also found the foley annoying because it was noticeable,0
i hate art in any kind of shape or form,0
of course they are in london where the young holmes detects a link between a series of bizarre murders,0
or has he simply gone mad,0
as a result this film will probably have more appeal to long islanders since mendelsohn was successful at giving it a genuine long island look and feel,0
and i was horrified to hear only one or two lines from the book shared between both characters,0
dom deluise does an excellent job as the main character of stanley the friendly troll,0
i watch one last dance quite often since i purchased it,0
if you did n't understand that at the end of the movie then you 've wasted your time,0
they then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s make way for tomorrow,0
i did not enjoy it because it made no sense,0
and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships,0
the lines given the actors are n't up to the task either and the situations which are supposed to be comedic are not,0
a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud a head on collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor human beings living like animals,0
expecting more from you like these classics,0
lol but the rest of the scene turns out to be rather bloody well it 's a good twist however global spoiler alert but the ending oh no how could it be,0
however unlike car wash this is n't a comedy though there are a few mildly funny moments,0
it felt like a dragged out terrible episode of the show with about 10 minutes total of funny things,0
reginald owen as miss alexander 's spouse is marvelously pompous as a man well equipped to bore for england,0
the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie,0
olivia de havilland admits that she only signed on to the swarm after her good friend henry fonda joined the project,0
i really do n't want to waste my time writing about it,0
scott spiegel has no idea of how to direct movies and his camera angles,0
does n't matter though you 'll enjoy yourself anyway,0
it was a total disappointment for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters,0
not even close to greenaway 's better work,0
so many characterizations about this period of life are presented through the eyes of characters that virtually no one was,0
this episode is slightly too long but the comedic acting keeps your interest,0
a raid while they 're on vacation in the mediterranean by some arab terrorist types allows a ruthless bureaucrat played by john cassavetes to separate father from son,0
this movie could be the worst movie i 've ever seen,0
the story and characters take several turns as the movie progresses,0
this was a period when story telling was paramount and movies unfolded gently with a respect for both real and theatrical time,0
wonderful cast wasted on worthless script,0
it is very well done and very interesting,0
it 's not about who the actor is sleeping with and how hard they 've been partying,0
presumably there 's something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him,0
the old marvel comic hero series from 1966 had much better voice acting,0
and for all of those who ask yes spinal tap came first but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either,0
we would n't interfere in the battle rites of some agitated desert tribe either unless we 're out for messing with our travel insurance huh,0
i 've always been a big fan of the film freaks and think it was very ahead of its time although in its day it was thought disturbing,0
so lame that there were a couple that you wanted to see die horrible deaths yet this never happens,0
in combination with the smooth editing and the technique of a film within a film,0
and why in the name of god does this movie have to be based in australia,0
the dialogue is foul and quite hilarious for it and while the plot is meager at best there is something infectious about the way everyone involved gives it their all,0
the terrorists are n't arab they 're really disgruntled american soldiers masquerading as arabs,0
acting was horrible storyline not very good,0
as disgusting as this film is and it is by far the most disgusting thing i 've ever seen it absolutely has to go that far to shake people up,0
calendar girls just opened in new york and i was at one of the first showings,0
i have n't seen a movie this bad since jcvd 's the quest and that was actually better,0
it 's anyone 's guess why sirk did n't pursue loftier themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities,0
i saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since,0
3 at the very last scene when it reverses you see him get shot outside of the bus and also the shake is thrown on his clothes at the bank from the girl,0
tom berenger is an actor who does n't register much as he proves in this movie but in the context of the movie he is right as a man of a few words,0
i and other geraldine page fans have already died and gone to heaven as we are shown miss page 's dark side and another tourdeforce performance,0
those will stick in my head forever,0
i loved it and being a horror movie junkie campfire tales was like dessert for me,0
i wonder if keith david got paid for this,0
but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction,0
i have tried to avoid saying this but the movie became rather cheap not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up but it did n't,0
what a shame to see the talented dianne wiest 's comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top she 's more bothersome than usual,0
october sky reminds me of a later 2001 japanese production of mini series rocket boy which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie,0
i was impressed by the staging and concepts,0
the wife loved the movie though and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for,0
i 'd read all the negative reviews for anna christie,0
as far as the cast is concerned they 're amateurish but tolerable,0
i love how the skeleton man randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day,0
they should 've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are,0
i would have passed on writing any more reviews of them until i and a few friends spent an evening watching the wizard of gore,0
raised by parents who experienced the great depression and wwii i can imagine a time when such optimism was not deemed overly sentimental or unbelievable,0
i give it a 65 or 7 out of ten,0
a similar theme would be far more effectively handled two years later in altman 's the long goodbye,0
to date i have read about fifty pages of mill of the floss,0
we get big closeups of the ugly chicken foot but nothing more,0
i do n't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story,0
then you have jamie foxx who throws like a girl,0
there is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking,0
but most of the time he relies on suspense to create his scares,0
in truth it is a fantastic representation poking fun at the way things were,0
i'm a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them reedited and redubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin,0
see it if you 're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you ca n't follow it and so confusing you ca n't understand it,0
this was hitchcock 's third hollywood feature and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the screwball pictures of the 1930s,0
i say objective simply because i have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series so i was seeing this as a film not as a spin off,0
after seeing the first movie of the director a very interesting moviei expected a better movie,0
jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work fantastic angles and keeping the film at a fast pace for the most part,0
i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors much better than the humans,0
as much as i love the simpsons i can actually say i like futurama more,0
no wonder they do n't have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else,0
he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial it does not mean that the character herself is strong,0
having lived the riches to rags to riches life personally the idea is quite appealing to me,0
but never mind all that,0
so you know in book three i was so hurt that he died,0
their big plan is to use flares to scare it off,0
this just did n't make sense and made me a bit annoyed,0
it stars samuel l jackson christina ricci and also justin timberlake is featured in a role,0
the characters are one dimensional clichs,0
i'm not sure how many words the imdb allows viewers to prattle on in their reviews but whatever that word limit is it is not enough by 110th to adequately describe the awfulness that is al adamson 's dracula vs,0
it just made everything fall apart,0
but one could understand such a cinematic film as this through its use of film language the glances between characters or their actions,0
on top of that it 's all wrong for bogart as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s,0
if some viewers prefer notting hill or you 've got mail that 's their mistake,0
this could easily be the worst film ever made,0
4 lots of crass unrefined sex scenes used either for comic relief or as prelude to something tragic,0
chase being responsible for the brilliant red river,0
it combines action love tragedy drama and politics all in one,0
for some reason the show 's producers almost entirely abandoned the macabre theme of the source and turned it into a wacky lovable oddballs make their way in an unfair world clich party,0
no match for the real thing though,0
the supreme tragedy of course is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular,0
for anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor and living watch this movie i promise you you wo n't be disappointed,0
channing tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression ever,0
but why why such travesty,0
but here 's what i thought of the film,0
first choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task,0
the movie is a complete waste of time,0
if you 've watched and liked the devil 's advocate and just like me you think the film seems to have everything necessary to be a good film but something 's terribly missing you 'll see that missing thing is right in its place in el dia de la bestia,0
i expected a better looking car than the one in it and where on earth was hasselhoff,0
even worse is the couple who portray paige 's parents,0
yes it 's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie was n't their ups and downs it was people coming together for one common goal to go to college where they were accepted,0
i heard that the secret service agents had to carry you to the transportation,0
deniro is a master one of my favourites,0
and what is disney 's obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals,0
waiting at the fair lady 's island estate are three small trunks only one of which contains images of the princess,0
the sets are amazing for a fairly low budget moviethe fight scenes are fair to slightly above average but this movie is so strongly written you can forgive the weaker fight scenes,0
then there is ruth roman who went to prison for killing her boyfriend,0
it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors did n't realize that a mine shaft that 's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire,0
she wears shoes with ankle straps that reminded me of the first girlie magazine i ever saw,0
the cops are too overworked between meals so she decides to hire miller,0
everyone wanted to see this movie which was not much more than a extended music video,0
saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor,0
the brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here,0
this movie offers nothing new,0
taken on that level it 's a good example of the biker flick genre,0
i am not ashamed to admit it here but this is one of my all time favorite movies,0
the look of this film is mainly grainy steady cam shots that inter cut with one another,0
master of italian horror dario argento is called a lot of bad things by nonfans,0
the running jumping standing still film is a comedy about english sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time,0
the tunnels are small because the vietnamese is small so it get 's extra claustrophobic for the bigger built americans,0
then the soul shows the mind the answer,0
instead of boring character development in an overlong equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going there 's not a single scene that 's a filler it 's balls to the wall plot,0
the last 60 minutes were distasteful and i began to lose interest in the film,0
this movie which will forever be known for it 's violent ending is uneven however,0
right now if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die just go out find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired,0
it simply boils down to the fact that the wayans were trying to add some wit to scary movie in addition to making fun of horror movies,0
they form a bond as rory seems to be the only person who can understand what michael is saying,0
you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life,0
angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you wo n't be disappointed,0
at least then the film might have been slightly shorter,0
the movie actually shows how the people both hindus and muslims have suffered from this partition,0
she was right of course but in three smart girls her first feature movie she has little miss fixit down pat,0
i'm not sure what i make of it all however i do know the film still haunts me and on some level colored everything i watched after that,0
ben 's intentions are noble if confusing,0
clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research troy 's mental problems are not remotely accurate nor are the forensics involved in the twist ending utter garbage,0
i am a happily married woman and i 've never had lesbian tendencies but my this movie almost made it something i crave,0
i would not have minded this too much had melvin 's life been at least marginally interesting but unless average and mundane are what you are into do n't bother watching this con job,0
the premise of along came polly certainly showed promise,0
who did n't know that takashi was doomed from the start,0
i understand television breaks but a few seconds to get you into a new setting would be appreciated,0
i always disagree with many of the oscar picks but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy,0
after less than half an hour you know who 've done the bad things and who will do it in the future,0
i had never heard of venus wars before and i think it 's a shame that the flick has n't got more recognition because it really is one good film,0
i understand she was trying to fix her car but she should 've ran,0
jim douglas as portrayed by dean jones develops the love for the little car,0
montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fianc,0
hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities,0
the film 's limitations make themselves felt,0
i would not say this is worth going out of your way to see but interesting to see how movies with human subjects were made in the 50s,0
the derek 's have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes,0
those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious,0
i really enjoyed the terrible albeit costly and lavishly done special effects and the cheesy all too predictable romantic yarn thrown in there,0
although a hilarious sitcom no matter what time period the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity,0
spoilers handsome and too pretty to be a pug robert taylor as boxer tommy mccoy is quite convincing in the ring as a professional boxer as he is out of it,0
however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile three or four times,0
i 'd never heard of it before buying it and i wish i 'd not bothered,0
i hope one day to do it justice,0
do not take this film seriously rent it with some folks who want to play mystery science 3000 and you will probably laugh your butts off,0
i mean come on now,0
moriarty gives away almost his entire plan at the beginning leaving holmes without a single deduction that the audience has not already made long before,0
first of all there 's a lack of action like in most other ultra low budget dtv action flicks,0
we watch a new horror movie every week so we have a very open mind when it comes to lowbudget films,0
the dialog was probably written in less time than the movie spans,0
1983 was a bumper year for stephen king books making it to the big screen,0
a good cast and they do their best with what they 're given but the story makes no sense the characters' actions are inexplicable and there are too many moments of unintentional humor as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off,0
the acting was good the picture was beautiful and trust me from some of the previews the picture could have been real bad and i laughed constantly,0
every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it 's pace he truly was a born filmmaker,0
irs and the kid were great as were michaels and perfect,0
otherwise it 's difficult to recommend this as a film,0
there 's no such luck in rules of engagement,0
the guy 's friend overdoses and dies causing him to continue his downward spiral into street drugs which completely turns him into a junkie,0
what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great,0
overall a good film to watch for the anthology fan,0
i was sad to see the original marc be played by someone new but after i found out the guy was in the short film crush i definitely had a better impression of him,0
why are things a catastrophe one minute and all fixed the next,0
overall this is generally uninvolving and it just plays on until you either finish watching it or rip it out of the player go to bed before it 's over like i did,0
leslie nielsen and patrick macnee,0
then there 's the gore,0
the action was supposed to be taking place in california yet the police cars all have connecticut plates,0
you ca n't get much worse than this movie,0
it handles some delicate matters and prejudices in a good and subtle way without making the movie ever 'heavy' to watch,0
it 's clear that nowadays there are excellent and bright tv series but north south was and still is one of its kind,0
there were some pretty good actors and actresses in the movie,0
as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out,0
i 've greatly enjoyed their earlier comedic efforts,0
it was not made for the entire family,0
the gang kidnaps her and he wins her back in a chopper race around the local school track,0
this is your great story,0
even my favorite actor bruce dern could n't keep my interest in this boring movie,0
this movie is definitely not a winner but i 've seen worse unless you have really nothing else to do then you can watch,0
if you 've seen it you know what i mean about teddy bears,0
the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies,0
i mean this seriously because the middle of the film strangely enough lacks his presence,0
army cowboys and many more insane stunts that cause bruises bumps blood and vomit maybe not just for themselves,0
it 's just fantastic to watch them,0
and he then hired alfred newman to write a new score and bam what an improvement it made,0
not a small enterprise the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits innovative for that time,0
that finally would have been the first thing about this movie to make any sense,0
the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are,0
the storyline really does n't make the slightest sense which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half,0
the premise is interesting and fun to watch but it 's sloppily done,0
what we saw in the movie was a total disaster,0
i was never sure how much time had passed or how all the random people kept showing up,0
for the most part the comedy is not cheap or dirty and then they add in levy 's bad gas problem to cheapen the whole film and honestly drop this comedy an entire point in my books but it 's done and said and they redeem themselves with other clever banter between them and a decent if not predictable storyline,0
now if it only comes out on dvd,0
the ending feels a bit rushed and contrived which is the only thing that keeps me from giving this film my top rating an 8 a lost '80s gem,0
see this film if you or someone care about is thinking about signing up to go into the military,0
this movie is just amazing,0
they mention herbie fang the shoe phone the cone of silence and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro 'd the show,0
most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background,0
jesus christ i ca n't believe i 've wasted my time watching this movie,0
this would 've been more at home in the eighties with these kind of musical numbers,0
i wo n't go in to an appreciation of each character but the other comments by fellow users sum up the appreciation of the various performances,0
ice queen is one of those dumb low budget shot on a camcorder type horror flicks the kind everyone seems to think they can make,0
welles with an uneven accent portrays michael o'hara a journeyman irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous elsa bannister finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband 's yacht,0
the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television,0
first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that lifetime movies,0
some viewers especially the younger ones cannot appreciate how actresses have developed over the lifetime of moviemaking,0
superb editing outstanding acting especially by epatha merkerson and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack,0
though the acting was good no one could save this terrible film,0
spoilers section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible,0
this is just so very good,0
when actors the calibre of david thewlis and paul bettany look this corny you know the problem 's behind the camera,0
the balloon ride and the giant rat were effects that one would expect to see in a 1960 movie,0
her role in this movie as the strong cunning female revolutionary is much more significant than women were usually given in westerns,0
blah blah blah it is hard to figure out what in the world robert englund is doing in this movie,0
in fact all are suspected,0
and you would n't easily forget that silly goody goody song that runs through the movie either,0
two were done by george pal with cb as uncredited producer,0
but mostly the movie sucks because of the wan performance of lucille ball who you 'd think would be able to make something of this largerthanlife character if anyone could,0
while the film itself was fairly interesting and included some nice touches it had an overdone quality to it,0
they 'll all have to get along and work together in order to survive but needless to say tensions arise and conflicts occur,0
for films like this one you 'd pay it and not feel slighted,0
there are really some unknown great surprising little jewels from the '50 's that are worth digging out,0
the film is wonderfully paced and judged,0
i went to the cinema with my boyfriend and a friend of ours and all three were laughing on end,0
the music by danny elfman i find to be his career best,0
at that moment deborah 's standin was over by the swings in the process of losing the greasy chili which had been catered that night and could n't answer the call,0
the story was quite philosophical with all the touches of sentimentality that make me melt like butter in a frying pan,0
and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time,0
the film had the makings of being one of the best if not the best in the series,0
the filmmaker was by the door,0
the line typically goes something like this 'i always work alone',0
this was not only an amazing high caliber performance but one that the passage of time has not diminished,0
it really left me with a feel good feeling,0
or maybe its because everybody else sucked so bad,0
the target audience is those whose lives share enough similarities with the characters that their issues appear real and critical,0
most of the other reviewers of this turkey have given it the pan it deserves but this is the kind of film that just invites more comments,0
god punishes the shat for questioning his identity,0
when a husband hires a detective to investigate a cheating wife that can be believed,0
despite killing the heroine off this is just substandard junk,0
it 's a real shame by the way that the british kevin spacey stage play version was n't an huge success,0
what made the original story be world wide phenomena is that it 's flawlessly written in this ugly remake they squeeze in a cute faced actor just to force the story to go on further and yes of course make some more while it lasts does n't matter if it comes down as out of character and totally unbelievable,0
the pacing is a problem also as the story mules along,0
their chemistry radiates throughout and both women deserve accolades for their performances,0
i laughed i got scared i enjoyed every little second passing by the screen,0
but i do n't really understand why it only got 61 in imdb list,0
remember people get paid to act like this,0
and yeah that 's it,0
i was n't singing you are the music in me the way i had been singing what i 've been looking for,0
dont waste your time you will only be disappointed,0
what is not believable is the truth and reconciliation process except that it actually happened,0
this so called remake is terrible,0
after a while it is all rather tiresome and fails to satisfy as the best of the old columbo series did,0
part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen gary cooper wc fields and cary grant are not recognizable,0
meanwhile the driver of the race car thinks he 's responsible for the race victories,0
it does n't contain much of his surrealism,0
he was a bastion of hope for the little man,0
the general public 's opinions never cease to amaze me,0
where else can you plug a film or boo it,0
dacascos deserves much better than the dross he 's been in up until now hopefully brotherhood of the wolf will net him some more major roles,0
i recommend it to everyone,0
this was unfortunately not the case in this film,0
who would come to see the movie,0
look bill hicks or not this film stinks,0
in the courts of ancient greece it was asked who stands to gain,0
in a series of different chapters the story is repeated all based around each character in turn,0
the review that was first posted for this video strikes one as a bit reactionary and defensive,0
do you know what wendy does,0
he has produced a number of innovative videos for various artists documentaries and short clips,0
i also believe that dark angel will become a cult favorite,0
frankly i was n't getting anywhere,0
and yet he giggles and wraps his arms around his buddy 's waist as they merrily stroll off,0
there are no voiceovers or interviewing,0
um i mean evil head,0
it does n't matter what all damned governments and bigwigs do good hearts will always find each other in this cruel world,0
the musical numbers were n't bad at all which was surprising considering how cheesy and long indian films' musicals are these days,0
a superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious russian serial killer andrea chikatilo,0
for such a distinguished cast there are more than a few shaky performances which makes the direction suspect,0
this movie told the tale of a people and their will to hold on to the purest sources of happiness and joy within their lives amidst circumstances which seemed destined to tear them a part and undermine their unity,0
i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day,0
movies have to have unique names,0
it does n't work period,0
i'm not into these sappy simple love stories some films have to offer but i enjoyed this movie,0
my rating in detail 1 star for cinematography 1 star for the music 2 stars for acting 2 stars for the script the only positive james burns obviously has tremendous fun playing the sadistic sheriff it 's a pleasure to watch him makes for 2 stars overall and that 's generous,0
and it 's got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around,0
sounds depressing but it 's not,0
here he had a halfway decent intellect,0
okay so it 'll take a while for this next part,0
the jokes are also strictly topical british and a lot just would n't be gotten over here,0
the ad art promised a dark smart horror pic,0
i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical,0
i do not recommend this movie for sht it was so bad and i felt like i was losing iq points during,0
it is arguably one of the best comedies ever made and surely the best bollywood comedy of the 90s,0
so they give it to you,0
an exception is randy quaid whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying,0
these shots are used to portray various intense moods of benny but are so used that they get very annoying,0
also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre,0
same year as female on the beach,0
brady who later won an oscar as mrs o'leary in in old chicago is the stereotypical temperamental diva who forms her own opera company and keeps changing the premier opera every five minutes,0
with this film coming at the time of bananas and sleeper one could not ask for a better time for allen to make this film,0
i highly recommend this movie to all who read this review and also declare it a must buy,0
me the fool went out and saw this on a double bill and wish i had listened to mr reed,0
alas menzies was never a good director though his films are often interesting to look at,0
the character that brings the most sparkle is definitely cagney though it took me some time to accommodate myself to him,0
similarly gloria grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress but she lost to celeste holm for gentleman 's agreement,0
i only know that showing a fired gun does n't make a film a war movie,0
at any rate this a great companion piece to vertigo as it again explores a very unlikely but powerful romance,0
the torture scenes are stupid and boring bordering on silly and everything else is just plain dumb,0
mr chris' comments are deadon so i will not repeat them here,0
where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants,0
do not pay to see this movie,0
or do they do it because they like the thrill of the kill,0
it does n't look particularly good and is n't scary or creepy just cheap,0
one more comment on matt damn he plays a smooth slick con man,0
the scene in which moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with curly in dutiful but dumb,0
the only negative about this dvd is that although there are quite a few topics in the dvd they do n't go in a lot of detail about them,0
aishwarya was easily at her best,0
it represents a rare and earnest attempt to bring to the silver screen a true story of ultimate gambling compulsion,0
examples bruce willis demi moore nicole kidman tom cruise i am sure you can name one couple for yourself who are acting in a movie but the acting is n't worth the movie,0
add to that the cheesy dialogue mediocre special effects and paperthin plot and you have the makings of a fairly good skin flick,0
santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour,0
unsurprisingly these operations which were clearly going nowhere come to nothing,0
please do yourself a favour and do n't watch this movie,0
you are now beyond the spoiler i continue to recommend the original highlander as a great movie to introduce people to good science fiction but always with the caveat that they must never see the sequel there should have been only one,0
much of the humour is predictable i mean when pumbaa makes up two beds a big one for himself and a small one for timon within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one,0
everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry,0
what happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm,0
my guess is that someone in production intentionally mixed things to sound best coming out of the speakers at a drivein movie,0
jury duty is now something i try to avoid figuring that back in the day i served on three of them at one time or another,0
fun to watch for those who understand the background and a complete waste for those who want mainstream,0
it was n't very realistic in that way but it did n't have to be to make a larger point,0
in my point of view justice worked through the hands of the female sheriff,0
the play 's humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash,0
it had sam jackson and his undeniable screen presence geena davis as i 've never seen her before demanding your respect and flat out taking it even if you do n't want to give it,0
if we were to look back just a little we see the rko radio pictures production of underwater,0
usually delivered in long soliloquies,0
we got to talk to the director of this movie after it was shown and he pointed out that he wrote in a week,0
it is after all real events of a civil war,0
at the speed as shown in the movie you burn the rope burn your fingers when you touch the metal parts of your gear,0
you know best picture best director best actor best actress best supporting actor best supporting actress best screenplay best animated film best cinematography best editing best art direction best score best song best costume best makeup best sound best short best visual effects best foreign film and best documentary,0
but meet the deedles ignores this and gives the audience something about ten years too late for its own good,0
they are the typical type of a younger brother and sister that nag you and annoy you mainly because they are bored,0
not with this film you do n't,0
good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book,0
for that reason alone you should see this movie just be prepared for a lot of silliness with bottle rockets the size of courier tubes and complete ignorance of gravity and physics and editing in some of the stunts,0
a comic book version of blackbeard 's story,0
have a heart when watching this,0
not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for bergman,0
the script really tries hard to uphold the mystery and to keep the real killer 's identity secret but it does n't matter all that much since we 're just watching the film for the murders anyway,0
this movie holds a special place in my heart along with toy story and others,0
this picture was not available when ted turner bought the rko pictures catalog,0
i'm not an expert skier but i know the hills here in arizona are more extreme than those in michigan,0
however i do not think that the anarchist 's cookbook was the right title for the film,0
he is completely immersed in the bliss of his own world and he is seemingly ignorant to the effect he has on others,0
that 's actually par for the course for an action film of this vintage and is understandable even if not really forgivable,0
the cast runs around like mad max wannabes and they seem to be sharing a joke that they do not want to share with the audience,0
i am sorry but in the end the story is very weak and this angers me,0
young 's own behavior is not really liked by his father an honest old style cop who is regarded as a hero by the department,0
kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th century england while spock and mccoy are stranded in a desolate frozen waste,0
as a theme one might say that the story is about the sexual education of encolpio set in the context of a morally declining world,0
makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy,0
audie murphy was a goodlooking man and the most legitimate of decorated war heroes,0
i have always checked imdb for reviews before but i think i will not anymore,0
i still ca n't believe that computer graphics are able to create 3d images,0
i felt this film moved along pretty steadily,0
what page did n't realize is that in fact she would be just that when she arrived,0
this was patriotic muck at its worst five and a half hours of it,0
it is a wonderful color softly shining and lasts throughout except at the climax when it starts to fade,0
i was excited to rewatch it on reel 13 because i felt that now as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer i could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be but no it 's still pretty boring,0
he 's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious,0
his direction is peerless as always,0
the shots inside the body were interesting and quaid was a great pilot for the adventure,0
that unfortunately included hitchcock himself as can be seen from the way scenes trail off or start suddenly completely lacking the master 's usual polish,0
i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store,0
but georges ca n't be shaken off,0
to be honest the only reason why i bothered to watch this movie was that i was sure they would show the leading lady naked at some point,0
the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit,0
the event was good 710 would have got a 9 if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena crack up in laughter,0
i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts and i recommend it to fans who liked shrek and shrek 2 and most importantly i recommend it to the people who love clay animation,0
the plot is ludicrous the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves,0
there were complaints that bergman got credit for things he did n't do and that he did n't quit when they said he did etc,0
it was a good movie,0
not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public,0
there is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people,0
which from the exteriors looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall,0
take your 5 and rent a real movie instead,0
i could n't have predicted that years after it 's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry,0
but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 's and early 70 's despite what hollywood may think,0
i could 've lived without that just fine,0
you would expect that they will link all events at the end together,0
this is not a bad movie,0
the other thing that i thought was freaky was the little kid 's nursery rhymes and as the movie goes on you realize that these have double meanings for all the murders which is pretty cool,0
it proceeds despite itself to formulate it 's plot out of significant character 's arcs and roles rather than playing to simply crowe 's predicament,0
i bought this film in a small shop not knowing anything about previously about it,0
after watching 12 a dozen or so thai movies i have realized one thing,0
now we know this movie is going to be really horrible,0
firstly i 'll give an outline of the show in a few words,0
i have 2 complete sets from time life this is my favorite movies of all time,0
the production values are not high so the filmmakers have n't even try to make spectacular actionscenes,0
did n't turn out so good a few deaths were involved and the creature was placed in a labyrinth beneath the palace,0
that movie became a hit and smith earn a cult reputation with it,0
also the film is well done,0
the kite fighting flight scenes generate the same kind of excitement that the dog fighting scenes had in tony scott 's top gun,0
people worry about money and job and kids so much so that they forgot each other 's feelings,0
while it contains facts that are not widely reported it is not exactly the truth,0
s epatha merkerson brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same,0
not only did not it change the movie story also this blending caused some ridiculous series of events,0
i guess so if you plan to fast forward through a lot of boring moments in order to see the naked bimbos,0
but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted,0
this movie really bores me,0
after over a year i watched across the bridge again as companion piece to treasure of the sierra madre,0
this show is sheer entertainment and does n't try to be a greek drama,0
at the three quarters mark i had figured it out,0
i particularly enjoyed the romance between brett and billy especially when she stood up to her sister ashton for the first time,0
it handles the audience with kid gloves while delivering a truthful look at societal problems,0
the second switches tempo with amazing martial arts action focusing on the fugitive ku and her friends,0
as a fan of chinese hero it is very disappointing to see this movie,0
this image is captured directly from the film 's opening but quickly disappears,0
one of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to talk sht to him,0
810 on my personal scale,0
still it 's difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy,0
the native american stereotypes are overwhelming in this movie,0
his father however whose life is the mine does not support him,0
it captures the laid back mid 70 's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad it 's good category,0
if that 's true i need n't bother to see the others,0
this is one of the worst comedies i have ever seen,0
that guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre tv series and even there he did n't play the main parts,0
okay i admit it did but what a stale closing,0
usually this is a way underrated movie and that is because it is the kind of movie you will watch for the story and not just the sex,0
to sum it up let my puppets come is a rather bland and boring curiosity movie,0
they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people not the creepily charming mastermind presented here,0
during the movie i lost hope when it did n't scare me at all when the kills were bad and there was bad cgi blood and cgi snakes,0
in my opinion after manos this is the worst movie comedy central has ever shown,0
first off the movie started off positively,0
we have few chances to see her though,0
some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody ever really touches anything because there 's a magnetic force preventing it at the quantum level,0
they do n't make such high quality films anymore where it 's character driven,0
this show 's characters were extremely irritating,0
i went to the theater thinking that i would be entertained,0
the story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations,0
i still ca n't believe i watched the whole thing,0
the soundtrack was actually decent and i 've seen a lot worse but i really ca n't recommend it except for gary 's two fight scenes,0
to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point,0
some gaps on the story are too difficult to accept you mean that the only person able to communicate that the bomb was not russian is a obscure junior cia adviser,0
i believe the two should not be compared or even connected,0
by the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it,0
coe was no suicide this was murder,0
i already have the story pinned down and plan to add some more once i think about it,0
lo and behold we have a revelation about jacques jr 's origins,0
not in the plot which is a fairly regular slasher story but more the way the scenes are cut,0
bottom line it 's funnier than the shrek films but scarier than the polar express,0
there 's a rather childish criticism of advertising but it 's a criticism that still exists today,0
but i would have liked to have seen it,0
beverly d'angelo has one chilling scene that i wo n't spoil,0
life is great for both siblings at first,0
the running time is only 97 minutes which makes the movie a little more tolerable to watch,0
i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection,0
is n't it possible that we may become angels to one another,0
you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it,0
without revealing the plot i can say that had he stayed the final scene which in no way strays from the noir would have rewarded his perseverance,0
i knew it was by uwe boll i found it in the bargain bin at a store for 2 but morbid curiosity led me to view this and 1,0
also the story lines conflict with each other perfectly,0
this is a fresh free spirited but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep,0
in addition to that they seem amateurish enough that they do n't search a robber that has actually been shot making it possible for tanner not just to retrieve a vital clue but also a loaded gun from a corpse about to be sent to the morgue,0
and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode,0
if i had friends like the five characters on display here i 'd be looking for new friends,0
this movie had a good premise and at a point in the flick i thought the tables were turning and i was really going to enjoy this one,0
this may or may not be chabrol 's best but it must be his bravest,0
the architect puts cigarette ashes on a saucer she breaks the saucer he gives her a neck rub she asks for a divorce,0
the character depth derived in this film is amazing,0
and sapna was killed in the first half was n't she,0
while i did n't think house party was the greatest release of the century it did have this genuine feel about it,0
what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see,0
being someone who is in love with cinematography and has a decent surround system to enjoy good audio this documentary intrigued me,0
just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered she 's also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous,0
i used to watch this movie every year faithfully when i was 6 or 7 yrs old,0
those who are disappointed because this flash differs from previous incarnations of their childhood should keep in mind that those other versions differed as well from each other and from the original comics,0
i also enjoyed the scenes with the lads trying to earn money as construction workers,0
scarlett is charged with his murder,0
escape from new york may be quite dated but it still packs a punch,0
maybe it costs more but it 's worth it,0
if any of you find this interpretation compelling and would like to hear more about it feel free to send a note,0
this film has it 's heart in the right place but unfortunately it is n't much of a film,0
possibly george lucas might have been able to do a worse job directing this,0
the climax uses the same sets same story line and has a fine actor as the main threat,0
the script is so full of holes i ca n't see how the producers agreed to finance it,0
sipping coffee that he stirs with his carrot,0
bruce willis probably did this movie while he was half asleep,0
like marilyn monroe 's incredible performance in the misfits the viewer is probably seeing a whole lot of her own demons in the character she is playing,0
she is stripped naked and forced to run from the crazy hunter who goes after her with a crossbow until she actually proves too resilient and he switches to a long range hunting rifle,0
andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective,0
this is a film based on a whole load of brilliantly memorable moments,0
in which sky are those stars shining now,0
it is confusing for no apparent reason,0
all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable,0
good movie all in all a must see for any asian horror fan,0
some suspense some drama do i shoot or do n't i,0
i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment,0
all in all i give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts,0
hands down the best dramacomedy show on television,0
it 's unlikely that anyone reading this was even alive seventy years ago when the film was made and that in itself is a remarkable testament to the staying power of a cult classic from a bygone era,0
well he goes to the room set aside for him and meets melissa 's sister,0
trial was not a celebrity freak show like the current michael jackson trial,0
heck even the spoof flick mafia,0
it just does and did,0
this film has about 10 minutes of the cute marisa tomei and 1 decent soundtrack song,0
it was a very well made movie and i loved the idea of fighting giant man controlled robots pity they had to spoil it by making a crappy spin off crash and burn do n't watch that movie by the way it is total pants,0
it 's a truly pitiful sight to see a once great actor at the absolute rock bottom of his game as he shuffles through the motions looking like he 's not just lost the will to act but the will to live along with it,0
but about five minutes into it i totally lost interest,0
the girl who seems to come out of space makes a journey through the united states from her highschool in new jersey to new york and all the way to california from where she takes into space again,0
overall i really enjoyed it and recommend it if it plays at a festival near you,0
how does life go on,0
late 30 's independent serial that feels like poverty row feature from several years earlier,0
he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family,0
it all made me want to ride horses and learn everything i could about their breeds so i could also draw and paint them,0
the movie it is at best when they focus on leslie 's bizarre character and when it is shot as a documentary the picture is really effective and sometimes very original,0
if you have seen the flash gordon or batman serials of the same period then you know what to expect,0
i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness and was utterly disappointed by the end,0
why you may ask when we have the largest children 's hospital just down the street,0
it is right out of your history book,0
unfortunately in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie,0
in the end it never actually informs the viewer about the history or complicated issues of the vietnam war and it does n't work as an antiwar film either if uwe was really trying to promote an antiwar message then it gets lost in a never ending haze of graphic violence,0
but it can be funny too,0
is he really as dumb in real life as he was in in the army now,0
bing crosby is in great voice but the songs are not his best,0
this script would not have been helped by the presence of any other third stooge,0
at that point the film takes a decided turn from touch of evil to cape fear,0
the opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar rendition at the cantina in chapter one,0
writing about a movie such as this being a stroke of genius is just one of many ways some people deal with an inferiority complex,0
tommy lee jones gives the most subtle performance of his fine career as the grieving yet stoic hank,0
the story is so absurd mixing thriller crime supernatural and horror in a nonsense way,0
even though this movie was shot rather recent in 1989 it looks incredibly dated and above all cheap,0
i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin,0
we know where they end up,0
and overall the movie is n't very scary there 's a lot of unnecessary gore and some jump scares that once it 's revealed what made you jump you get mad at the movie for startling you for nothing,0
who say they cant help her but call back if she has any more problems,0
cat in the brain wo n't convince any of fulci 's detractors in the opposite but it is nevertheless an interesting part of his filmography,0
and for a 15 million dollar movie the producers did a great job of building lavish sets and costumes which give the appropriate mood and texture to the movie,0
three actually that pep up my day and make me smile,0
both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building,0
this is his achilles heel and it makes the audience realize that for all the glamor and fame he is not a happy man,0
the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor,0
really they spelled it brain in the credits not brian,0
but i felt that tiger the lead character was a scumbag,0
fatty finds it and gives it to mabel as a gift and many problems result,0
where to start oh yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking that witnessed a crime you committed do n't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away,0
most of the time i am able to take solace in the fact that even matrix revolutions had at least a few seconds of highspeed visceral action despite the unfathomable script and plot,0
once you get into this story it is impossible to put down,0
they might have got the episode order wrong i ca n't remember but it at least was on at a regular time every week,0
the only reason i sat through the film was in the hope that i might catch up on some sleep,0
unfortunately i was left regretting that i 'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the great scott,0
i enjoy the movie for what it is and do not read anything deeply dramatic about it,0
the film takes in pretty much every trash element of the style of filmmaking from naked babes to a masked killer and the film is like a catalogue of less than tasteful actions and images,0
i have n't heard such lovely lines like the epic one word beginning to the movie fk,0
bearing that in mind where are the jokes,0
is this city located on some other planet one which merely resembles our earth,0
and as for serious subtext the movie ends up with about as much depth as a young adult horror novel,0
i think the key to this failure is the abysmal writing and directing from scott spiegel,0
anthony edwards overplayed brains to a fault bill paxton as jeff tracy just did n't work despite decent acting there were better choices for the hood than ben kingsley and many others that i do n't care to mention,0
ustinov cowrote the script and it was thought well of at the time but i found it unfunny meandering and a sad waste of a great cast,0
i was amazed at how cinematic it was,0
that concept is n't too bad however where this movie goes horribly wrong is that each torture is displayed and filmed in detail,0
this movie was made in 1950 people in their 20 's and 30 's have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not oscars,0
his whole look seemed fake and he just did n't seem natural in the role,0
an episode involving a child supposedly bearing the mark of the beast,0
and it does not necessarily imply the lady loves to be tortured,0
i 've seen suddenly a couple of times now and found it quite gripping,0
as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh,0
alan bates as her manager is top drawer too,0
jim jarmusch 's night on earth is a tricky movie,0
i do n't know about chemistry there was more chemistry between dandridge and peters than there was between dandridge and poitier,0
these tricks got the movie a few important prices in film festivals and get the movie an undeserved commercial success,0
i think they got the idea and the character 's names right but it stopped right there,0
she also may be seducing their sons,0
it smells like the ocean,0
nothing was ever ever said about morgana in the first movie she just pops out of nowhere trying to steal the baby,0
in the box not much has changed,0
it 's a strange yet somehow impressive story about love,0
it was like some parody of student films,0
in the beginning of the series he 's such a cool guy and tries to be like his father but lately i do n't know why he becomes a very very dumb dude and he starts being a problematic guy,0
loosely based on actual events river 's edge is a film much in the style of david lynch about a group of teenagers who are aware of a murder committed by one of their friends but no one does anything about it for a long time,0
use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story,0
i 've seen a few message board comments trashing this movie but let me tell you an opposing pov,0
however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels,0
it was a daring move on fox chief darryl f zanuck and it was a breath of fresh air to the mormon people as this was the first film attempt to favorably show their faith on the screen,0
it caught the imagination of everyone across the board whether straight or gay,0
rather i think the only people who can give 1010 are subhash ghai vivek oberoi and the remaining cast of the movie purely because they were in it,0
one of the many problems with this film was that marc did not have a strong screen presence and his performance became overpowered by the amazing performance by jenifer lopez who did such a wonderful job i started thinking it was more about hector 's wife than about hector,0
in candlesticks she got a chance to play the kind of glamorous clothes horse role in which marlene dietrich specialized with no occasion for jealousy at all,0
the one good thing about this film is the performance by his blind friend well played by jeff daniels,0
another dud australian film which proves to me that the quality of australian films has declined since the good old 1970 's 80 's when all the classics were made,0
no one ever said that a film had to win oscars in every category to have a profound effect on the viewer,0
followed by the sequel 666 the beast which also went straighttodvd,0
or why did n't you tell me about this at our twice daily update meetings that a task force of this magnitude has,0
a hard thing to do in my opinion,0
she can not explained how this has happened to anyone,0
i first saw this miniseries as a child and though i am a child no longer i still love it,0
the most creative thing you will find about this movie is the nice ps picture from the official poster,0
could bela be the monster,0
in this documentary we never learn why shoesmith is a hitman we never learn who he kills and why or how he feels about it we never learn who he works for and we certainly never learn what makes him tick,0
i enjoyed most of it,0
some of the acting however is wooden especially in the long conversations they have about morality,0
the showdown between the predator and dutch is quite a pay off,0
after their friend drew does n't come back the rest of the group goes to look for him,0
i can only imagine that had this story been done with a 100 curly or shemp that it may have been a very good entry in the stooge film library,0
seymour waiting his life out for fry to return or the poor dog knowing where fry was and fry 's parents not figuring it out despite being in the room fry was frozen in,0
scenes in dance clubs that do n't look realistic,0
from a purely cinematographic point of view the dialogue was rushed the almost nonexistent plot focused too much on minor relationships and details and none of the scenes elicited the response intended,0
after i complete the paper i will post another comment,0
i 'll admit i did n't actually watch this movie from the beginning i only caught the end,0
i 've always thought that most huge boxoffice flops usually have something to recommend them but after the remake of around the world in 80 days and thunderbirds i'm beginning to doubt it,0
and the second entry would go onto be a prequel which explained a lot about misa 's past and how she became to be a witch,0
think of a great woody allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good,0
unless your a hardcore lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80 's style action movies then avoid,0
the people who like this film seem to be parents worried about their teenagers and boy are they barking up the wrong tree if they think this film will help with understanding teen issues,0
our intelligence is insulted our tastes are ridiculed and our freedom of choice turns on us and squeezes its fist around our throats,0
i rented this movie and stopped the movie at the middle,0
namely happy endings are n't very common,0
i went to this movie with the stupid hope that it would be good,0
in real life at that time nobody knew about the gas chambers least of all benny who was completely uninterested in politics,0
this is the best turkish movie ever,0
it was me who was very impressed about this movie and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one,0
again i know it was stereotypical but i have a couple friends that do actually act like that,0
the young actors are mostly unknown but mostly talented and add to the overall positive impression the film made on me,0
uncle wayne i think looks a lot like mcconaughey and is fun to see them together in a movie,0
the subplots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw,0
good episode for the simple fact there are no monsters in this one,0
mindless thugs do play their part and there is an utterance of the most overused villain line of all time bring him to me alive i 'll deal with him myself,0
in kpax softley brushes on the subtleties of eastern religious mores from the small archetypes embedded all over the film to the actual purpose of prot,0
this is not one of those bad movies,0
if you want to watch a wellmade and fun film about hacking then watch wargames,0
there is too many cooks trying to cook this sad excuse of soup,0
yet at the end grace lovely again runs after bing and good old bill just watches from a window giving a stylish long and elevated shot of bing and grace going home together,0
i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa,0
the dialog is one long unwavering cringe,0
he manages to escape but is now a man pursued by many who wish to bash in his skull,0
greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named amanda who is in love with him kills herself,0
this stuff is almost too awesome for television,0
but while in a hotel room in las vegas after they 've all revealed some secrets they decide to have an orgy,0
of course the cia does not track international art thieves but what the heck,0
the movie manages to be as slow as a snail yet impossible to figure out whats going on,0
this is a european title so i do n't know what differences in dialogue etc,0
like his death showed us he was too nice if anything,0
the whole cast is excellent and the sensual open tone of the movie mixing the fairly straightlaced couple their young child middle class friends and family and the worldly young man and depicting them ultimately as not really all that different is almost comforting until that ending which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development shattering the mood,0
the viewer does n't have long to think and is suddenly thrown into a new unusual episode,0
but after only one viewing it is not clear why loud classical music has to figure twice in the scenario,0
once abe learns that the white light means that the person is going to die he decides to save people,0
while i had certainly known there was a time in theater when men played women 's parts i had never before thought about what might have happened to them when women were finally allowed on the stage,0
what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack the person by person destruction of a mansion the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth,0
this is in my opinion the best brazilian movie ever made,0
it uses all of the clichs out of the book and this movie really does n't offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original,0
with a respectful almost humble approach to the original film he manages to capture the essence of bambi and setting up the events that lead to the original 's conclusion,0
even friends who we have loaned the tapes to that had no interest in the time frame returned the tapes with gratitude for the loan and highest praise for the series,0
if somebody could please explain that to me,0
chico organized his own big band and went that route to keeping busy,0
i truly consider tightrope to be by far one of eastwood 's best acting performances,0
space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera,0
it is hard to figure out who bob 's wife was in the later show because of this,0
by the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the grinch 's and i ended up giving this a superb,0
the story line seemed to go nowhere,0
as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute,0
why are democrats given such a free pass in this film,0
i saw this movie for the first time in an old small town movie house in big spring texas back in 1978 seeing the film where i did is one reason i will never forget it,0
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative,0
overall if you like gangster movies you will like this,0
in some instances the actors were so acting that it was just unbelievable,0
the only misfortune to come from this movie was the fact that many people slept on it,0
but not if riff randell can help it,0
unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse,0
this next line should just about do it,0
this film is well cast often silly and always funny,0
compared to another recent heinlein adaptation starship troopers this film was much truer to the author 's original work and is a thrilling and thoughtful treat,0
the worst is watching the directors commentary and hearing how dead serious the guy is,0
no good can come of these prophecies,0
new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil 's club scene,0
i'm not sure how this script was ever approved by movie execs but someone must have been feeling drunk that day,0
her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over,0
by the end i found that i loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired,0
i watched this adaptation over christmas and i think under any other circumstances i would not have been able to endure this and certainly would have not been able to justify the wasted time,0
ps two teachers were fired for doing the same thing coach nash did a few years later talk about art imitating life this was life imitating art,0
why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul,0
you do not need a monster to make your movie scary,0
it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but i absolutely had no problem with that this time,0
this one however was one of the worst,0
the plot and its development is a work of art,0
so if you want a movie that is a little different,0
funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a softporn fantasy,0
ben stone realized that being a doctor in a small town might even mean having to read to your clients personal letters to them because they could not read,0
he cried when 1 he told her he loved her 2 she got sick 3 chris klein came back and he saw how happy she was w him 4 she died,0
she says well you 're back now,0
i had to replay the scene two to three times just to catch it all because of how hard i was laughing,0
here is a culprit who blends in so well he can never be caught,0
the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students,0
he is bigger in stature but not quite the jack palance goodness,0
not even yeoh can do anything with such poor material,0
which also goes by the name second chance is a blend of melodrama mixed with clich and a touch of the occasional huh,0
the script is horrendously stupid,0
overall i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers,0
having a soft spot for the genre i purchased the dvd sight unseen because i had read enough about william s hart 's work to pique my interest and thought i should have at least one of his films in my video collection,0
in typical rb soundtrack fashion the song failed to appear on the soundtrack,0
the picture was filmed largely in death valley and is striking in its great visual beauty,0
so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was,0
potentially offensive and just downright lame,0
it 's available on dvd and is very funny,0
sherman was a southerner turned yankee during the civil war,0
i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part,0
what raises asoka above the usual epic drama is not only the strength of its story but power of its performances,0
absolutely a must see show,0
must be that sense of mystery and what is going on here,0
and a comment on the political situation of north and south korea,0
i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly falling into something as important as love,0
she 's bridget 's younger sister and the two 's extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes to much of our amusement,0
this movie is mostly a patchwork of elements from the novel,0
but these days spending what would appear to be about 30000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic,0
i think the reason i like this movie so much is that the comedy duo of billy crystal and danny devito make for some interesting comedy both slapstick and verbal,0
but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought possible,0
one of the most aggressively weird australian films in years,0
and then since god was not the only perfect entity anymore they both got together and created woman,0
that 's the situation that captain brian donlevy at the fort has to deal with when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection,0
the extremely naive and idealistic coleman must learn pronto how the music business truly works and play the lowdown dirty game as best he can or else he 'll lose both the group and his credibility,0
however this second one belle 's magical world is definitely inferior,0
the one scene that underscored it was when after rescuing the drunken president grant grant asks tonto what his reward should be honor your treaties with my people,0
i would definitely see it again and hope that he continues his film career,0
all that aside the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision,0
i know the other team was to look intimidating but that was crossing the line a little,0
otherwise you 're better off just passing on this movie,0
the racial tension between the main police officer characters is always present and noticeable yet moral values and speeches are never shoved down the viewers' throats,0
there is also a reporter who is more important during the first stretch,0
the art looks like it came straight out of a comic strip,0
is n't that the best thing that a movie can do,0
i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented,0
in the alternative future created by our alternative past the future will receive the sample from us but they wo n't be able to control it and time will end,0
unfortunately i ca n't say i laughed out loud even once during the film and neither did i care about the story or the characters,0
however the ambitious bigoted colonel graham finds out about the gold and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it,0
she had a good two weeks of nightmares but continued watching,0
given that fact and leonard maltin 's unpromising rating i had suspected that it was going to be a big disappointment when i eventually catch up with it but happily it turned out not to be the case,0
a sick bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole,0
morris day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements,0
perhaps that 's the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare,0
sure we all have different taste in films but to call this movie perfect is absurd in my opinion,0
besides the fact that this movie tried to do for the fourletter word what saving private ryan did for dismemberment it stunk,0
it seems like she cannot eat or drink anything without it having blood previously injected into it,0
the special effects are surprisingly good for this film,0
the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to i do n't believe that anybody could write that an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma,0
the effects are cheap looking but effectively gruesome for the most part and funny when they are n't,0
and since when is american pie have anything to do with the dukes shame on them for putting that nasty line in there about having sex with a car,0
unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of jhorror,0
if you want to see a rock and roll veteran wonderfully perform new stuff this is a must see,0
i was bitter when i found out kelly only repeated himself,0
as this film presents the scene these two men were not intoxicated nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs,0
it was without a doubt the worst movie i ever paid to see,0
but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether,0
the performances in this film also vary with jackie giving a very solid typical chan nice guy up against it role but this is by no means his best acting role that can been seen in the sammo hung directed film heart of the dragon,0
he played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well,0
however as a monster character it never really comes to life,0
that 's what someone who has n't seen the movie may ask,0
i actually had to stop my tape once when that scene came up because i was crying so much,0
in light off all this i decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief,0
speaking spanish being latino has nothing to do with it there are also chinese filipino 's polish russians and dozens of others that are smuggled into the us canada and european countries each day for the same purpose a legion of cheap workers that must remain silent and live in fear,0
the crime caper films of quentin tarantino for example are filled with violence profanity and other sleaze but are nonetheless highly watchable because tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art,0
in reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany new york with the wwe championship,0
special effects would n't look out of place in a 60 's sword and sorcery flick,0
all in all it 's not a very good movie,0
even if i sometimes agree with the message there are more subtle and elegant ways to convey the point then spoon feeding it to me like i'm an idiot,0
this movie intends to display this glorious event fit to hollywood images but trust me it deserves more than that,0
she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects,0
the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin wo n't like her because she 's ugly,0
when you 're not scratching your head you 're yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit,0
she was always the romantic interest her roles were never meaty but she was pretty and wholesome and was often teamed with robert young,0
the answers to those questions are present in each of the 12 stories presented in this amazing film by surrealist master luis buuel,0
one of those late late late show movies on cable that you watch when you cant sleep or have nothing better to do,0
did austin rogers pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills,0
almost needless to say but the production design and cinematography are sterling with warm and inviting environments a veritable extension of the optimism with which these characters ultimately face their uncertain future,0
sadly that something never really comes,0
this movie vampires the turning is n't even really worth the 2 out of 10 i'm giving it,0
it 's all really lame and slow,0
we need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant,0
and something interesting did happen,0
if they had only made the darn thing funny at least but john landis who is usually pretty dependable as a comedy director seems more interested in putting cameos by directors in every scene so it will at least be something that you can kill the time spotting,0
if that skill is being used for good or evil fact or fiction is another matter,0
it 's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like i did because this little known gem receives no wordofmouth,0
he wrote a fantastic documentary of 1924 this early 20th century geography of today 's iraq was powerful,0
237 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them,0
who comes up with such plots,0
the movie 's plot is ridiculous but it does n't matter because it 's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale,0
it is in other demille 's movies too but never that much as in the crusades,0
the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm,0
stephen king did not and i repeat not write kingdom hospital he simply bought the rights to it,0
guess that 's some small victory too,0
the movie was shot in part in california 's columbian historic park in 1955 anyway i thought the movie was excellent and realistic well told the writing was excellent and well acted by everyone involved,0
the doctor comes across as not a bad man but a bit clueless and insensitive when he learns that a patient speaks what appears to be some slavic tongue he asks lucia to try talking to him in italian but slowly,0
if you are pretty familiar with the genre girdler 's sheba baby does n't necessarily stray too far from formula,0
the music and the images compliment each other beautifully,0
in the first few minutes i assumed it would be a romantic drama on a tropical island,0
both stars incredibly dart across the stage with all of their usual exuberance and in his final filmed performance fred astaire apparently still retains the liveliness of a man two decades his junior,0
power has driven him mad,0
it 's a wellcrafted film imbued with i'm 's uncanny storytelling ability,0
so many brilliant scenes abound i cannot recount them all,0
i am with those who think eleniak deserves better roles than she normally gets but better she is working than not at all,0
yeah that 's the ticket,0
she had such a sense of humor,0
this flick is worse than awful,0
too bad even he ca n't save the girl from rio from being a huge letdown,0
the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting,0
the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the country 's fall to revolutionaries,0
so if you 're looking for a journey over sometimes bumpy terrain that never forgets about the joyous qualities in life then mask would be it,0
i was still putting the pieces together hours after the movie had ended,0
all the people who voted a meager 1 on this movie this is all i have to say you guys have not matured enough to enjoy cinema of this kind,0
would any woman ever really forgive a man for that,0
not much is happening in its first halve but also from the moment one when the cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers show up the movie does n't really know to become exciting,0
i love the long cut,0
it 's not perfect it has many flaws that have already been explained in other comments one of the main one being that the story is so vast a standard feature film can hardly do it justice,0
with so many good movies coming out in 1995 unfortunately there had to be some bombs as well and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring predictable plot and a lousy ending,0
there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion,0
then when the characters started dropping off like flies we should have know the end was near,0
the movie its story is good and foremost entertaining,0
but the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected,0
the film ends as john farley agrees with his teacher 's methods and thanks him for the bad way he was treated in school,0
it 's amazing that henry fonda made the fantastic once upon a time in the west the same year or thereabouts that he made this atrocity,0
my recollections of the series are largely critical,0
the scenery and sights were spectacular but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous,0
foxx does n't just play charles he recreates him,0
even so they end up going to the same uni and that 's where they become friends but as jennifer can pick any guy she still continues not to be satisfied and where ryan was concerned he seemed like the perfect guy she could talk to since he was n't interested in getting involved with anyone there were no problems between them,0
this movie was very good,0
how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending,0
plus madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack,0
for instance i doubt very much that the scenes when we see the actresses ice skating or dancing would have been included in an american production,0
but with the exception of anthony quinn and that memorable dance sequence he does with hayworth i found the rest of the cast particularly the young actor rex downing who played juan as a boy unconvincing and altogether uninspiring,0
outstanding acting by all which is evident by the fact i liked greatly or disliked intensely the relatively small cast,0
i love everything about the show and the characters,0
this one was n't even released on vhs to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making even dustin hoffman in his debut,0
the film begins with a funeral of one of jody and reggie 's best friends,0
so he sends his two retarded minions to kill macleod,0
even his body falls apart seemingly under the great cosmic weight of his hatred,0
chaney deserves all the praise in the world for his portrayal of the tragic lenny,0
story of ireland in the 70s,0
but the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps,0
son of sinbad gets as high a rating as it does for the sheer campiness of the film,0
the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people,0
i have almost finished with the last season and it is as good as i remember perhaps even better,0
i expected a grand scene of the coronation and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds,0
an absolutely amazing man who died 7 years after this film,0
ms hayden has written a couple of books on health and fitness also,0
very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long,0
i hardly cracked a smile much less had anything that would reasonably be even misconstrued as a laugh,0
julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays,0
they both eventually meet up with the other surviving prisoners peter francois and skip,0
this moody british horror film was made several years before the stalk 'n' slash genre kicked off yet this atmospheric chiller possesses a number of elements that would later become popular in the modern horror genre,0
the men in his family all died by the age of 45 so he figured he was n't going to live a long life and therefore did n't see a need to take good care of himself,0
it builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer,0
i went to school had friends of every color creed religion for the first 8 years of my life,0
the script is written to be able to let 2 year old understand what is going on,0
several points 1 acting none 2 plot must 've have missed it because i was probably protecting my eyes from this tragedy 3 character development does the main actress going from shy and idiotic to ghetto and idiotic considered as character development,0
the existing series continued as if nothing at all had transpired,0
also for you guys out there who like nudity in your movies do n't be fooled by the r rating,0
imagine a hideous remake today for the multiplex mob adam sandler and drew barrymore instead of cary grant and irene dunne with rob schneider in the randolph scott role,0
french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will dislike it intensely,0
it all starts with a hostage situation at the british embassy in london where rainbow team is called to intervene and then various missions most of them based on the original novel 's situations and a secret deadly plot comes out from behind this sudden terrorism wave,0
it built tension the good old fashioned way through people and their interactions,0
it could be seen as filmic surrealism in a nutshell or as something of a postmodern acid trip through film genres,0
one could almost call this a sciencefiction story ming the merciless would be quite at home here,0
in life is beautiful however roberto benigni 's character guido is jewish only because the film announces that he is,0
it 's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way,0
does she want to kill millions,0
over all if you liked the book you will like this if you like the miniseries then you 'll love the book,0
of course the room number is 13 which must have required a great deal of thought for the writer to come up with something so original and is haunted by a woman who had a relationship with a minister,0
the purity of their former passion,0
yet the plaudits must go to martin short in a truly great performance he has never matched,0
if not always in the right way,0
the success of the last one was repeated by this remarkable western,0
with each additional viewing you find yourself discovering that it is in fact a work of genius,0
i did n't mind this movie as this was made in the 1930 's and it was a black and white movie,0
as usual john sayles flushes out the very human qualities of his character,0
i did n't laugh but i still think it 's stupid,0
the movie had a very racy and sexually charged edge to it that was unique and most likely very realistic in the context of the era,0
all have done wonderful work in the past,0
not only is this film not funny it is not even interesting,0
what he and the other actors actually do on stage while not unusual for a keystone film is n't particularly funny when seen today,0
the end result certainly lived up to her expectations,0
and he seems to have an eye on sybylla,0
i really liked dennis hopper 's character and really liked the younger talent,0
with the ghost of the past he sees himself as a child take the photo he knows it 's in his pocket so he 'd be embarrassed about it and would n't call attention to the child saying forever,0
this is one of those performances that 's just like a conduit into the heart of the magic of broadway and theater itself,0
it is unique in its perspective the images are not excessively violent and the score is outstanding,0
i miss seeing gary oldman in good films and hope he makes smarter choices in the future,0
guys will think lucky julien,0
seemed like a madefortv movie,0
this film is not perfect but the message is fresh and completely different from any other film i 've seen,0
but what really makes this movie so wonderful is the story line,0
the sometimes imaginative staging is pretty to look at but none of it manages to stir up more than a modicum of interest,0
i loved how it told the story of each of the zboys and the history of dogtown,0
this is no small feat for an independent film,0
centered around a chain letter originating from a group called the brotherhood of the 7th day the movie shows 7 episodes each consisting of one day during one week where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it 's rounds,0
the names of the main characters burt and ernie,0
perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of judge reinhold saying something such as a car is an extension of its owner,0
the film is filled with the wonderful comical scenes and dialogues as well as the scenes of chilling suspense,0
for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books,0
this puts the viewer in a frame of mind similar to phillippe 's character helping the viewer feel the disorientation and encroaching paranoia and madness along with the character,0
their extraordinary performances in 1998 's love after death lift this story to a higher plane,0
if you just want to watch a sappy horse story okay this movie is one,0
i am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on dvd,0
then the captain and his daughter along with some other guy figure out how to kill it,0
this gives the tension between antonio and angelina which is an attractive aspect of the movie,0
this is not the case with scott foley 's rendition of after dark my sweet,0
i guess nobody really knows because there will always be two camps who will each tell their own truth one camp says he was a hero some kind of robin hood the others will say he was an ordinary criminal a murderer and a thief,0
are we finally about done with this reality show bs,0
but i seem to remember it being harder to kill the guys in scream 1 than this guy,0
that 's the real story,0
it does n't mean you have to show it all the time,0
this has got to be one of the most atmospheric movie sets ever to be captured on film and it just gets better from there,0
pat o'brien made six features with powell more than anyone else except james cagney,0
the awkward and dysfunctional dynamics of phil 's family are the direct result of his choices and approach to life,0
the camera is so jerky it made me sick,0
the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates,0
then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife,0
clearly john huston meant to show that he was still in the full glory of some passion by making it even as his body was failing him,0
just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance,0
there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life,0
the list of memorable performances goes on,0
one reviewer liked it and said that the film had less energy than traditional hitchcock suspense films,0
7 the final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the standing still time and the alien departure,0
if she is she 's not a very bright one,0
george clooney plays a psychologist or scientist that has been summoned to check out the strange phenomena happening in solaris a world in space,0
even ali 's troubles are not convincing because we do n't see it we just understand it from his words,0
with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents,0
in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films' banner,0
this show would have done better to be the same,0
this show needs to come back i 've seen every episode and this is real quality,0
paperhouse is poorly acted laughably plotted very corny and dull on the whole,0
this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably tv made sequel,0
obviously aficionados of terrible filmmaking will want to see this but it 's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a badmovie viewer you are,0
why stick his face down between her legs and suck the poison out of course,0
the film is honest about why the moms are in prison and the failures of the program as well as the successes,0
in my view this is the best road movie ever made,0
it 's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer,0
the acting is really bad especially in the first episodes,0
call me oldfashioned but i think of movies as a means of communication and communication is n't complete if the audience does n't know what the hell the director is talking about,0
this isnt good bad movie it is simply bad bad bad bad bad movie,0
that cagney could convey through his performance the power of chaney 's art is a tribute to both,0
ok i may be exaggerating but it certainly came off in the same manner,0
please do n't go buy it and ignore the positive comments about this film because its basically the cast writing reviews about there own shitty film because there out of work,0
ok i love seeing danny trejo in films,0
there are so many good sources while i understand the commercialism involved in making such a tv series i never understand why producers and directors believe that audiences will tolerate such poor quality as fare those interested in merlin would be advised to read mary stewart 's trilogy,0
the film was definitely very impressive to look at,0
the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous,0
it 's typical of hoffman 's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with midnight cowboy is voight,0
do n't rent it do n't watch it do n't even say that it looks interesting,0
on top of this frank pokes fun at one of his pupil 's gay parents and seems to delight in embarrassing harassing and stalking ben,0
in fact this is almost an nc17 film,0
even though i gave it a 110 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on tv anywhere,0
the viewer gets the sense that she does n't enjoy what she is doing but sacrifices have to be made in life,0
like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons this movie has humor at different levels,0
it was more of what i would expect from a dd movie,0
octopussy works better as a comedy spoof similar to spies like us,0
i felt truly let down by dana carvey as i hold him in high regard due to his work in the wayne 's world movies,0
enjoy i know that i sure did,0
read the bible next time echo bridge or do n't make another bible movie,0
for one it did n't have the corny special effects that the big budget movies have,0
the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat maybe the original idea was good but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty,0
he has n't just gone to seed,0
otherwise see a drama or something,0
i know it was the filmmaker 's device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think we 're that stupid,0
now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i 've read about the movie,0
but i have n't seen eyes available anywhere else,0
but in this the producers had a new idea for james bond he will be on a personal vendetta the idea was bad and so is the final product,0
i like the story and i think that 's what vanilla sky is more than anything,0
the us civil war the english rich inventors,0
if you are searching for comparisons to help you decide whether to watch cold comfort farm imagine a slightly older pollyanna going to live on a rundown version of babe 's english farm with a strange and bleak collection of her country cousins,0
overall this is a fantastic cartoon,0
now if you can ignore the silly and racially insensitive casting you still probably will hate the film because of the horrible writing,0
kicked in the head is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies a lot of them suck,0
the show does n't progress introduce new elements or play around in its own rigid format,0
this is a fun fun movie,0
it 's a great comedy and a great romance,0
of course this being a dirty harry film we see him dealing with a shop full of armed thieves in a way that leaves the shop in ruins and harry transferred to personnel a department he does not hold in high regard,0
what i enjoy about green is his ability to find humour in such simple things as a cheese sandwich,0
just give it a try and see what you think,0
one of the best ever,0
however if you want to see why she never became the star she quite probably should have become just look at the films like this one that her studio put her in,0
the movie has two questions that rusty must answer is fame all that it is cracked up to be,0
sad it 's very sad indeed there is no truly gripping and compelling storytellers anymore,0
robert de niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career,0
he is forced to make up news in order to give his fellow prisoners hope,0
it is too obvious that this movie was made for tv,0
all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say,0
and all that 's left is the string of events that made up her career without any substance whatsoever behind it,0
the fact that the central characters are gay quits being a gimmick after the opening scene,0
this film is absolutely horrific,0
there was no interviewer there were no questions,0
when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry,0
bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers' world wide,0
the window of ale is a great one,0
you might say it was for the sake of comedy but it was way overdone and inappropriately shown,0
nbc miniseries about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family,0
why was buck so struck,0
it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edward,0
2001 definitely was the best year for wwf and its first ppv starts things off nicely,0
hard times hard life adapt and survive,0
misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else,0
because it was very funny and it was just a hilarious story and well thought out,0
besides no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders,0
no difference on that part looking at this movie,0
problems 1 although billed as a loving tribute to poverty row a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films much of it is from rko 's the most dangerous game with some from the silent version of the lost world,0
i understand the director wants to try to do something artsy,0
as a disclaimer i contributed to this effort after the fact providing music for the soundtrack but i was not involved in the creation of this film and i could not tell you a thing about repo man except that i remembered seeing it way back when,0
he constantly begs his mild mannered supervisor alan arkin to scream and yell at him like their boss did,0
really really disappointing impossible to recommend,0
somehow the sword has ended up in the higurashi family temple in modernday tokyo and inuyasha and kagome everywhere throughout japan,0
i suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you 've ever seen,0
without spoiling anything i must let you know,0
a lot of lynch 's trademarks return the dual personalities time folding in on itself gratuitous nudity and another tragic murder mystery,0
the music in it will stay with you,0
i say this because he found someone who did n't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself,0
when i first saw this i laughed out loud at the obvious satire of our society 's need for sex and violence in our entertainment,0
zhang 's treatment of the aesthetic both visual and aural is moving as ever,0
because death does not exploit us humans,0
they all live under one roof with no one to help them out,0
the absolutely stunning keira knightley appears as liz 's friend frankie,0
the extravagance needed in many scenes is not given and the dialog is tiring,0
too much of it reminds you of la confidential except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself this one is so loose it steers everywhere but where it should,0
the leads are capable but there 's also a sturdy bunch of secondary performances,0
i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did,0
it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music,0
mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christie 's novels,0
there are a few minor flaws but it 's probably the best of the spoofs,0
now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack,0
for all women ca n't be happy unless they have a man even if he is a creep,0
all the beautiful cinematography in the world could not save this movie,0
this is the worst movie in the world,0
the problem is beyond all that,0
they rob and josie move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other 's house,0
the film is said to be somewhat inspired by bonnie and clyde but more than anything is an interesting exploration of how fate and circumstance can lead to disaster and tragedy,0
ahem now anyways it 's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife her lover in slow motion,0
for example the name should scream do n't watch,0
this movie gets a 110,0
i felt that i had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me,0
these are scrambled in a snowstorm,0
it really is too bad for just cause had more than enough potential,0
i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting actoractress,0
this is the worst dvd release i have ever seen,0
and they gaze into each other 's face for hours and hours it seems at a variety of camp fires on their trek to the sea,0
first viewing i thought it was funny,0
if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther,0
some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable i would of rated this lower but they have n't got anything else,0
3 there 's something oddly emotional about it,0
what it does contain is excellent cinematography by gregg toland superb direction by john ford and a superior script based on the plays of eugene o'neill,0
he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes,0
i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good,0
the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van dien who hardly has a part,0
both the storytelling and style of the movie can be called unique,0
the songs are catchy the casting of the musical characters hilarious the costumes well see for yourself,0
okay there are a lot of bad new horror movies out there but these is really far from the worse,0
amanda begs harold to read the script and make changes and she will arrange for him to be paid for his work,0
so why is n't this on dvd,0
not that he 's a bad actor his performance surpasses that of many of the others,0
brad pitt was soso as a disillusioned vampire but looked so gorgeous in his fake teeth who cares,0
it is a great contribution to the local film industry and films like these with high quality deserve good production and not only support for the commercial mainstream in the philippines but also in cinemas worldwide,0
if i know you this offer is void because i would n't inflict this movie on anyone not on purpose,0
kurt russell turns out a pretty nice performance,0
it seems to suffer postproduction problems in script particularly as characters vanish while others make such preposterous choices which could cause irreversible results,0
adam sandler 's best by far,0
its fascinating to watch pizarro becoming more and more fond of atahualpa and at the same time it becomes more and more difficult for pizarro to decide about the incas fate,0
please it 's insulting to john cassavetes as an artist,0
this might have been a film the coens had made had they been born in oslo and not minnesota,0
children really do not speak this way,0
it 's very confusing but that 's only one of its many problems,0
the end of the movie is abrupt and anticlimactic,0
fay wray looks really good,0
i thought it killed the beautiful images seen on screen,0
the plot is amazing the acting is amazing and the directing is amazing,0
its amazing to see fully grown men act like this and being serious about it,0
this is what i would consider a diamond in the rough movie,0
at that point everything registers and the story makes sense unfortunately it 's not much fun getting to that point,0
unfortunately in terms of actual filmmaking the story is n't really done justice although it 's not so bad that it really weakens the film significantly,0
the plot is obvious and almost arbitrary,0
plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they 're going to happen,0
in my opinion eddie monroe was cast wonderful,0
and not to sound racist or patriotic or whatever but give me a trashy and mindless american epic over mongol any day,0
annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance,0
it 's not may contain it does contain spoilers,0
directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme this lowbudget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country,0
the main problem with this film is that they only interview black people gang members and the few white people they do interview come off as retarded and somewhat racist,0
i would call this movie avantgarde if it actually made any impact on me,0
the track is irritating mainly because of them,0
a must see for thriller fans 810,0
i know we all have busy lives but a return to beautifully prepared meals and great conversation is much more needed in today 's society,0
he shows humanity he tries to be cooperative as opposed to being oppressive,0
what bullshit big brother sees you and then some more,0
this movie is literally a talking picture and the location of the action is sometimes just a pretext,0
or the concept of water water everywhere and not a drop to drink,0
the script is horrible and apart from satish shah the acting was horribly cruel to the people watching,0
the script is simply laughable,0
still allinall a pretty forgettable and unimpressive film in almost every aspect,0
it is saturated in orange,0
since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites,0
the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession,0
it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but i thought the ending was great,0
when i heard godzilla 2000 was coming to american theaters i was really excited,0
i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women and spent more getting them to remove their clothes they did n't have any money left to get them to actually do anything,0
or what benson hoped to gain at the space station,0
the suspense and terror builds credibly and effectively and manages to take the worn out damsel in the old dark house plot and not just dress it up but actually transform it into something new and original,0
i can still remember what those still left in the theater towards the end spontaneously and simultaneously yelled at the screen when joanna said i 'll be back,0
yet panic in the streets remains a perfectly watchable movie mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch,0
that was n't intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally,0
jason peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead,0
a propaganda film for the palestinian cause,0
and the scenes themselves are way to predictable,0
most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting,0
the costumes tread a fine line between historical accuracy and the requirements of the movie code but still manage to convey the era and the fairytale quality of marie 's court,0
everything about this show is terrible,0
but sadly i can not recommend it as a depiction of one of the great blues singers of all time,0
only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family 's line continue,0
you wo n't find anything new and original in this tired agonizing outing,0
he just has that air about him that makes a great detective,0
she does selective roles but shines in them,0
now the second story begins to unfold,0
there is no logic behind it,0
this movie was made and distributed by the mormon church,0
we only wish we could see a more real portrayal of them,0
the dubbing is not great but i also like godzilla movies so i am used to badly dubbed movies,0
likewise the supporting cast particularly marlene forte as lanisha 's mother compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film,0
now and then a bad movie becomes unintentionally hilarious but most of the time bad movies are simply bad,0
we follow paulie 's adventures as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner meeting many memorable characters along the way,0
it 's fun and nostalgic,0
the only reason to pay attention is that at any moment you 're going to see something incredibly stupid,0
given that the presentation had no appeal to me i was at least expecting an engaging story,0
the other is a single shot that was deliberate and well executed,0
i would like to see the dvd on this one too,0
it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves,0
a somewhat prophetic piece in light of recent events and the exposure of america 's tactics in iraq,0
at this time colombia pictures was obviously trying to wind up the stooges contract so the writing and direction are just not there for them,0
nicole ritchie at least added some edge now she is gone from the show,0
ruth 's loneliness and overwhelming gratitude causes her to keep trying to reach billie 's heart and she does,0
the amazing thing is how the cast came up with very creditable english accents,0
for english speaking viewers if you can get past the subtitle problems you 're in for a real treat,0
if lots of blood and crazy behavior on a farm in dark territory inhabited by ageless creatures under the spell of a crazy guy is what rocks your boat then welcome aboard,0
and oh yeah not much happens at the camp because the producer michael big explosion bay thinks that summer camps are n't scary,0
as i 've noticed with a lot of imdb comments certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness,0
kicks him in the testicles,0
i bet i can guess the password to the fbi in 3 tries,0
here it gets a little more interesting but not enough to save the film,0
at least they cannot say they did n't warn you kind of like the button labeled do n't push this,0
i do n't ask that a romantic comedy be high art but this was barely a romantic comedy at all,0
you recognize her voice more than her face and it takes a while because you are struggling internally with disbelief like if emma thompson had made an appearance in the new guy,0
it 's incredibly dumb offensive and appeals to the lowest common denominator,0
the cast is populated with some of warner brothers' best character actors of the early 1930 's but the result is more outrageous than funny and after a while you just want someone to kill the family and be done with it,0
this storyline lasted over all of the series so would have come to a really good ending if only i could remember it,0
the direction must be faulted as well,0
if the poor quality of the production was an attempt to provide authenticity let 's err on the hollywood side and come up with something more watchable,0
probably best just to stay away from this one seriously anyone giving this film more than a 2 needs to see a shrink fast,0
the older man wo n't even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it,0
it had good intentions until shue went crazy,0
some of them i have seen remakes of and i remember liking them but not the originals,0
what a pointless way to use a great cast and the film making talent that was evidently available for this piece of work,0
being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie,0
she meets him has sex ties him up and then murders him in cold blood,0
too cartoonish and very disappointing,0
if i have a granddaughter some day i will get this dvd and watch it again with her,0
at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it,0
cook continued with success on broadway where his style of acting could be tolerated,0
six gis about to be send home and discharged get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia,0
the only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from aykroyd 's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he 's a fraud,0
he is joined by a feisty candice bergen a wily john huston and a captivating brian keith in one of his more understated performances,0
sound 1010 the sound was fabulous,0
i watched this movie at 300 am and i was suppose to be at work at 600 am needless to say i was late to work,0
the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in,0
storywise it would have been better off set anywhere between the fifties because technically it 's akin to the much better far from heaven in melodrama or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late seventies into the early nineties,0
gary cooper is good as usual and i usually do n't like jean arthur but i liked her here,0
with that the royston vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th century romp instead,0
it seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments,0
honestly my brain just could n't fathom the logic of this film,0
so definitely some people enjoyed this movie,0
for example anytime she wears the college girl uniform she immediately gets naked like in the glorious scene at the confessional and then while performing a striptease to tease the construction workers,0
the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film,0
again you 'll have to watch to find out what happens,0
and the other characters were just as good,0
a fictional tv series is seeing its viewing figures dwindle,0
it was an overall dreadful boring and slow movie,0
ajax 's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior,0
did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards,0
i immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere,0
next comes the black woman whose initial response to holmes at her apartment door rings completely false,0
and so is horror queen barbara steele who costarred with adrian paul in dark shadows as her name is barbara steele introduces the film 's most bloody victim,0
real people do n't stand around and scowl or constantly act serious about everything and only say things that have to do with work,0
daniels is almost too good in this role he reminded me way too much of people i actually know who are like this,0
this guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob,0
and seven ways to die,0
i have watched this movie thrice now and enjoyed it thoroughly every time,0
to give it even more of a chance of being confusing these elements are not shown chronologically,0
a chorus line takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes,0
better acting and more believable,0
either that or he 's laughing really hard,0
i always admired how a good surfer seems to not care about anything but that moment that wave that experience,0
8 out of 10 stars,0
the human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious,0
80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more,0
watching agent of death aka the alternate i had the feeling that the movie was going to suck,0
it should have been called frank herbert 's dune for dummies,0
although 18 different international directors took the challenge not everyone of them is good some of them even boring,0
as noted earlier the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting,0
in this case it 's inconsistent,0
and yes he can play piano,0
we all want to fall in love,0
it was so strange to see that they filmed inside the houses not studios it was my kitchen bedroom and living room,0
and there is not a to be continued after this episode,0
if you are gonna torture yourself then do n't invite your friends unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them,0
despite what some of the reviews here state i actually prefer the way the filmmakers decided to handle all this,0
mikhail kalatozov 's the cranes are flying is a superb film,0
this thing also manages to down a helicopter with a single arrow,0
in fact the title might be a smug invitation for those who are n't real fans yet join the club picking up where junior left off the story begins with tony being absolutely fine,0
i'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat,0
the greeks visited britain before the romans not to invade but just to trade and there are some descriptions of their customs looks and music,0
try 'the big night out' for similar results,0
porky sees a mirage of the camel sitting in a pond of cool water and tries to jump in with it and finds himself buried in sand,0
this is not to say that the directing is technically inferior because it is excellent,0
later she gives birth to the son of the earth,0
this night listener is better than people are generally saying,0
they could have handled them the flash backs in a different way although not sure what,0
unfortunately it 's technically good and i gave it 410 but it 's so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment,0
jerome kern 's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song long ago far away is the theme music for this musical,0
i 'd recommend it to die hard john waters fans but otherwise it 's a bit dull,0
and i hear from certain sources that the film in the works station 13 is going to be much much bigger budget and will be one to really look out for,0
filmed on the cheap by charles band 's full moon entertainment production company in bucharest in romania the production values are alright better than many later day band productions,0
in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia 's body and all too seldom on her paintings,0
if you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much,0
at least when compared to different columbo movies,0
i kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie,0
there 's no tension either between characters or in the society,0
but once it gets rolling get ready,0
you can have fun finding the others,0
i 'd say it is not such a bad thing that this film has faded into obscurity right after its release,0
after what is a close approximation of the last teen going through a house of horrors the films ends on a truly predictably note that once again feels ripped from tcm,0
however it 's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as the english patient,0
the horse they said would win winds up winning and charlie itchy and ann marie are payed 1000 for the bet,0
these stories from the 30 's were short and if one looked at lester dent 's outline for writing them they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment,0
what 's surprising is how many name actors wound up in this effort with one on the way up one on the way down and one still going strong,0
no need to issue a spoiler here because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly disinterested in the ending,0
but as you watch you keep shaking your head at the overall quality and cheesiness of the whole affair,0
although there is allegedly a story running through the film we really have no idea what is going on thanks mainly to the unpolished look of the film the lack of dialogue and the amateurish ineptitude of the acting,0
i have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long,0
he provided the only solid good acting in the movie,0
there are very few directors to either manage to dig themselves outta that hole use that to their advance,0
after lauren is dropped off at her school a young man is wearing a columbine jacket which is the first we hear about what school officially she attends,0
surprisingly enough it is this movie is directed by oliver stone and therefore is one of the best directed films of our time,0
what would happen to people who lived then,0
here 's a brief listing of all the crazy stuff occurring in this film,0
you 'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just does n't,0
sixteen years pass this is the very beginning of the film,0

i 'll also praise and mention at least once a week movies that i love such as fight club the matrix amelie and other very good movies this movie however i can honestly say was so bad i could n't sit through it the acting is nothing short of atrocious the lines are terrible the realism pathetic and the fact it stole the name from the original is actually insulting,0
but i'm glad we got that out of the way do you people catch my drift,0
i find it disturbing that anyone would rate this movie a ten,0
although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a in my opinion not that well managed splatter sequence,0
is during the commercial break,0
the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i could n't say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence,0
at times it is good jews and blacks vs the evil white christians,0
coolio has to be the single worst actor to ever star in a movie,0
all in all one of the most overlooked best laughoutloud movies ever,0
that 's about it really,0
the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon 's character 's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition,0
however due to bankhead there was some humor in lifeboat,0
however all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie,0
for reality try watching the pianist,0
first of all i want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie but more importantly i think i should explain why this movie is so terrible,0

the entire creative staff has obviously gone to the michael bay school of film making and failed,0
while i was watching rita hayworth do her stuff i do n't think i 've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since i saw moira shearer in michael powell 's masterpiece the red shoes,0
this a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed,0
one thing props up in my mind every time i think about the film the betrayal,0

all that needs to be sorted out are the characters,0
all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite,0
even those of us who like cute animal pictures and i abhor them would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film,0
a little more old fashioned,0
back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters,0
i 'll make this short and sweet this movie sucked,0
yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain,0
every scene is shattered by human tragedy,0
flawless from beginning to end,0
but the rest is nearly unwatchable compared with the original four daughters,0
maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment,0

joan cusack i have liked her better in other roles,0
at a running time of approximately two hours and forty minutes the film recreates a piece of history sought with fragility and values conveyed to the viewer,0
but joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she joan sees youth herself at 18 eager expectant a little frightened asking 'what is life,0
can i say sucked in my review,0
not all things at the end of the rainbow glitter,0
i think the piano 's out of tune,0
when trey parker and matt stone were writing the script for the movie they had to make a decision if they wanted to dumb down material for the nonfans,0
after being disappointed with down with love more so with the script than with her character development i was not expecting much from this movie,0
she is pregnant and has decided to run away from her situation,0
however any lack of acting ability on gackt 's part is mostly masked by the fact that the character he plays is prone to being overdramatic,0
first of all i admire bruno ganz in his original voice an actor with a wide range of possibilities who fails to work his charms on you because he is given very little to work on,0

his problem child is indeed a means by which to expand your consciousness,0
no objectionable material a good family film,0
the best parts of the movie involved subtitles and a sunset,0
for one thing they have no reason for sue and johnny to go into space,0
this may take a few viewings for it to sink in,0
like most of this film 's characters we never really know what motivates felix to chatting up alex and even setting him up with a woman in the bar that i assume was a hooker,0
which is well accepted as i thought it could have copped out with something more accessible,0
there is only war war horror and staging the horror to make it palatable to those who do not live it have not lived it do not remember it,0
episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love betrayal and a homicidal escaped lunatic dressed as father christmas,0

one can at least muse about the layers of meaning that could have been possible if charlize theron a genuine white south african had been cast instead of nicole kidman,0
you do n't necessarily lose out on your dreams but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first,0
a truly fun movie to watch,0
but then again when you have poor direction poor writing poor everything acting is the last thing to criticize,0
dragon heat on the other hand is just terribly mediocre,0

although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie 's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting,0
i ca n't imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously,0
do n't worry i'm calling the police right away,0
yet even had chaplin not buried the film in his vault for decades the very fact that it was made between two of his greatest critical and financial successes the gold rush and city lights two indisputable silent film era masterpieces may have fated the film to its nearly forgotten status anyway,0

it also contains multiple shots,0
not to mention the rock just about anything he 's in is a good movie,0
saying any more would lead to a spoiler and just in case any of you are seriously considering watching this film i would n't want to ruin what little entertainment value there is in it,0

lewis' classic collection of seven novels which is part of the reason that expectation was so high in anticipation of its release,0
flawed primarily by a low budget but two major problems come to mind,0

there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattooed,0
this is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of japanese cinema,0
at least if i had wasted that money on the crane i might have taken away something warm and fuzzy with me,0

this film is so bad it simply defies reality,0

all 3 or so songs of it,0
i completely see what the writerdirector was going for and he hit the target perfectly,0
natalie portman 's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical,0
and i also confess that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring those love and drug stories there are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense but twin peaks ca n't catch my attention,0
however to this day this movie is still one of the most beloved comedies in decades,0
the director sun cheung has a style apart from the other more well known shaw directors and he handles the fight scenes with finesse as well as the rest of the movie,0

however the movie is quite charming in its way,0
the mother sandy tries to hold the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband also,0

i saw this film on september 1st 2005 in indianapolis,0
this has a rather ambiguous ending though but other than that it 's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that that 's because it 's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate,0
two chuckles and a headache,0
i came away from dead man 's shoes with a sense of pride a sense of acknowledgment a feeling that british film at its lowest budget level and at its grittiest and simplest is very much alive and active,0
i can think of many worse ways to spend 70 minutes of your time,0
here are the worst of the worst parts,0
juan who they did find at the end of all those sea lions battles the monster,0
sadly this time she looks even more silly,0
it 's heartwarming in a really special way,0
dennis quaid and robert duvall,0
so it 's not really all that bad or dangerous,0
there are definitely some lulls but overall highly entertaining,0
so watch it because it 's a spoof not just another one of those movies,0
he deserves to be in better than straighttovideo films,0
they appear to completely forget the fact that gaby reese is one of the most beautiful women in the world let alone the most gorgeous athlete,0
the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable,0
to the people who think this movie was boring open your eyes to the real problems in our society,0
in house of dracula you can see the factory like production values of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise potentially scary movie,0
i sought out a copy of the forest because i was watching a vh1 special i think where are they now and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor corky pigeon,0
the usually great udo kier is passable as the clichd villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad,0
oh and by the way the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise,0
of course due to the time limitation the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part iii of the book,0
why oh why would that dear boy whom everyone had such high hope for after the sixth sense be in something this truly traumatizing,0
there are smooth cameos by joan blondell john carradine and dorothy lamour,0
our heroine fiona is a quiet child who tends to isolate herself,0
i realized the punks embraced dissent in the form of doing nothing and embracing it,0
his group becomes irritated with chris' obsessions and gives him the boot,0
it 's absolutely one of the best films i have seen,0
therefore it 's my expectation that in this case the book must certainly be better than the movie,0
in fact refrain from filmmaking altogether,0
master cameraman james wong howe surpasses himself here especially in one sequence in which price emotes with an improbably large map of arizona behind him as a backdrop,0
he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute,0
he has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing,0
this is a magnificent movie,0
stanley plans to find out,0
however my blood pressure rose several points by the end of the film due to how irritated it made me,0
the dramatic scenes are a joke,0
love your pets no matter what they do cherish them forever,0
the villain is dr ock who 's ticked about something so he plans revenge on the city of new york is it,0
it is a rare event when i rate a movie on the level of a 10 but if i could i would go even higher for this film,0
the interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders,0
quite why this film gets to be called cannibal holocaust 2 when many better films get stuck with thinking of their own title is beyond me but there 's no way that the green inferno deserves to be associated with the ruggero deodato film,0
i found myself amazed at how bad this really was,0
ritchie even takes us into the wilderness in attempts to bring more laughs and eventually draw an ending but again nothing happens,0
i went from suspended disbelief to fidgety boredom to almost walking out,0
this is by far the best role i have ever seen sean penn play,0
i have a few minor problems with this movie,0
it made me jump once but with one swift bowel movement it sunk again where it belongs at the bottom of the sea,0
where did chris stokes spend most of the budget for this film,0
but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters,0
i got this movie thinking that it would be great just to watch for the scenery,0
as soon as i saw the ad for changi on the history channel i knew i 'd love it,0
of course the story is a little different but it is the same thing,0
the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and once defined the family is divided the younger generation off to america,0
like the surf dudes giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half,0
it falters at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme but all in all i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it big impressive powerful bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty,0
if horror films were graded on a curve and categorized into five year intervals then i would say dark ride was average in comparison to what we 've been getting out of hollywood,0
almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness,0
this movie ca n't decide what it is a soft porno or a sf movie,0
fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds,0
if you can get past the somewhat corny style you 'll really enjoy what old films could do better than all our contemporary technology,0
adel imam was great as usual,0
call me a dolt but i utterly did not get it,0
when linden tells her of his discovery of a permanent dye she is thrilled that this may be their chance and wants to invest in it,0
both lead parts were passed over by several actors,0
and this is where the story really starts bang,0
actually it is the tank for the penguins,0
night live people in the movie,0
i am planning on buying the dvd so i can see it again and laugh at all the bits i missed as i was laughing so hard the first time,0
so what 's the score with you the living,0
what better way to make an encore performance of a classic tv series,0
the whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending believe me it is not a surprise it 's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic,0
again it 's like the filmmakers are saying how can we possibly make it any worse,0
in essence everyone gets the same a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money,0
should n't someone report the rape and get after those guys,0
then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling while trying to dial 911 sound ridiculous,0
not recommended for those who like fast paced movies or those who are looking for the usual scorcese,0
what was with the trial,0
i have watched this movie several times and it 's better than the killer shark movies produced nowadays by the scifi channel,0
this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film,0
boy meets girl boy tries to win girl 's heart despite being a dorky pervert boy somehow succeeds against all odds,0
i will never be a member of any club that would have me especially this one,0
trainspotting has a strong feel of time and place while 28 days later mirrors the british apocalypse writers of the 1950s,0
naturally it 's possible to attempt both tasks fail at both tasks yet by some fluke hit upon a work of art that 's good for independent reasons,0
what a brilliant film it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films,0
that everything is better if you have more money,0
i recommend this prison drama for drama and racial issues and a superb story,0
the stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film,0
different strokes for different folks as the saying goes,0
they know he 's a good old boy,0
only people who tried to live their lives or to make something out of their lives,0
i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death,0
am i the only one who thought this series really stunk,0
the time traveler 's wife adapted by screenwriter bruce joel rubin is a bitter sweet and strange love story,0
though it 's obvious that they love each other still this movie still keeps you still on your seat wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects ben and katie might fight over again and again,0
i wish i could have whacked it with a rolled up newspaper,0
but fate seems to be written on the wind and it is not long before a conniving marylee a secretly smitten mitch the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar,0
beautifully done like a dream with a purpose,0
the president would not have been allowed to stay at the white house for a minute,0
the one natural gal here is humiliated by the director,0
in fact the british version is way better and that says something since the american truly is a great show,0
seriously stay away from it,0
later i returned to practice in a rural town,0
north and south is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos,0
storyline is it just me or does it seem that kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles,0
greta garbo also does a decent job in the film as the prime ballerina who just wants to be alone,0
i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline,0
this point alone makes most of the philosophical discussions that take place in the movie insulting to anyone who has bothered to look up the words nihilism and anarchy in the dictionary,0
the acting was subpar at best though i would say it may be chris kattan 's best job yet,0
the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role,0
they fire mercilessly and raise a uboat capture net which separates loch ness from the greater ocean,0
the style of everything is a nice 1940 's style from clothing to the cars,0
yes as soon as bruce at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a god why do you hate me,0
everyone is 100 sure that as soon as mr iturbi so much as hears ms grayson her operatic career will be a reality,0
anyway that said the robot was pretty original looking,0
there are many things that charlie has done that makes david think that his daughter actually did them,0
this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really,0
he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view,0
the plot is just your average story of a witch wizard or warlock who is put to death but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it etc etc,0
the only big mistake here was director mark rydell 's casting of his reallife son christopher in the pivotal role of dixie 's adult son,0
every night boot up my tivo and begin watching,0
the fact is that it 's a movie for adults and patient adults at that,0
men may need to make a bigger jump to understand women in the way women do,0
or is learning to fly much easier than i thought,0
this film represents what excellent moviemaking is all about the journey of a character to selfdiscovery,0
i liked him in this movie,0
kermit the frog used to live in a swamp,0
it starts out with a fake looking chinese aircraft getting struck by lightning,0
tim robbins and bill murray in a kid oriented movie about the last city on earth,0
while not quite as accomplished as the later movies he develops a very simple story of a young married couple the subsequent kidnapping of the husband and the wife 's attempts to persuade the authorities to help free him into a wellrounded movie that works on almost all levels that it encompasses the love relationship between the two main characters is credible and wellhandled the struggle of the individual citizen vs government authorities and individual desires vs the larger scale of politics is dealt with intensely and even the interplay of the kidnapped and the terrorists works out really well even if it seems sometimes that rishi kumar was lucky ending up with these rather than more ruthless people,0
you should see this movie at least once because it is absolutely awesome,0
the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion,0
is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top,0
i watched it because it aired on cable,0
twenty years later the film is still awful,0
the gem of the film is the humor,0
but i still love jeremy jordan,0
his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice,0
is she truly trying to say that moore literally created the report in the film himself hiring an actress to pose as a reporter and putting a fake station logo on the screen,0
if you liked the first installment of the bill and ted series then i would hope you would like this film as well,0
even though cannibal man' does contain a couple of nasty butchering sequences it merely is drama and an alarming social portrait,0
it 's honest and it 's brutal and the directors want the audience to understand the picture but not without thinking about it or watching it numerous times,0
it 's faster and automatic and some later enemies use it,0
the special forces were harried by gunmen from all sides,0
they then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out,0
add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not,0
some of the lesser character actors have terrible dialogue delivery,0
i bought the soundtrack and dvd immediately after watching it,0
now you may be thinking hey,0
and it bears repeating the cinematography is gorgeous surprising at every turn and just plain mesmerizing at times,0
the story could have been decent but it never takes off,0
this version is nothing like it,0
that 's coz every time i tried i fell asleep,0
if you 're told it 's insider movie about russian politics it 's not,0
also it seems these flicks provide livelihood to the canadian locales where most are made as well as the host of canadian actors appearing in them,0
for some reason the lady in black likes to visit little tommy,0
he did n't inspire any emotion at all except boredom,0
snoopy and his bird friend woodstock suddenly set off to meet her,0
everything in his room has been painted,0
it has a feel of a play written by an untalented highschool student for his class assignment,0
this movie is a lot of fun,0
the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses,0
this film should be required viewing in high school or college history classes across the country yet one can only find it on obscure latenight tv if ever at all,0
as he describes the events leading up to his outing we fade in out of the scenes,0
rob roy is simply a film about those with honor and those who are truly evil,0
i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish,0
all in all this movie although it has a nice blurb on the back stinks,0
the singing from owl jolson and the rest of the music in this short is very good another thing that makes this short worth watching,0
old fashion love story despite the perhaps arguable marriage angle distraction,0
and these mere two facets can do nothing to hold back the torrent of terrible filmmaking the movie unleashes,0
that said there 's really not much positive to say about this boy coming of age film,0
you get more of a plot swirling a bowl of alphabet soup with your spoon,0
that 's basically the idea behind this charming film,0
did not impress me at all i was not scared i did n't jump at any parts and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of,0
a year later gracie is feeling like a new person while bob is just beginning to think about his social life,0
granted with all the things wrong with this film not much would have made it better but a competent lead actress might have helped a bit,0
fairbanks does not so much act as he dances the role,0
did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing,0
in short terms bebop is flawless,0
it makes the movie confusing and also from an engaging one to watch,0
my wife and i really felt ripped off,0
the animated photographs are wondrous seeming to bring long tack sam and kin back to life,0
but the movie itself is good,0
the plot is your typical 90 's lame pop culture brain rot,0
still i too would jump at a chance to have a second look,0
although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film,0
i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan,0
when i was the age of either male stars i did not have those problems,0
video covers are among the things that force you to buy a movie so do n't always fall for such tricks,0
why do we not see them in the later episodes when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value,0
some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason,0
it can reach all ages,0
because what this movie lacks and it 's hard to fathom why is joy,0
perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors,0
i recall an interview with milius where he explains that he based this movie on the games he used to play as a kid,0
if the germans want to fight they do so and that 's also the end of the movie,0
angus scrimm also just did n't seem entirely into his role,0
i just hate one thing about the simpsons,0
although i think robert patrick is quite good he is still no match for david duchovny as an actor,0
every year i check with no avail to see if the christmas list has been released,0
the story is good and there are many memorable lines for those who enjoy this genre,0
the script was so real it was amazing,0
double team is another useless action comedy,0
i had seen this movie long time back but found it amazing and to this day it has never stopped amazing me,0
watch it if you like these kind of movies,0
what a waste of time to watch this movie,0
if you 're a film student this film is indeed technically brilliant,0
had the ending been good it would have gotten a 2,0
i would of given this a 010 but because of the girls a 210,0
ewan mcgregor just looks embarrassed as do josh brolin and patricia arquette,0
now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good,0
you can go ahead and watch it if you please but i sort of would not highly recommend it to you because of the tedious arrangements they made with the plot,0
i can honestly say it is a film i have quite grown to like,0
this was sad for the audience it should have attracted it did n't and fell by the wayside,0
it also gives heston a chance to play his quintessential role of a man at the end of civilization,0
overall this is not a movie worth seeing,0
the world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty,0
and i know half as much as these guys do,0
a man steps out of an apartment block and is accosted by a vagrant who pulls out a gun and politely requests for a dollar to buy a cup of coffee,0
he is just another fellow a family man trying to do his job and get ahead,0
huston was fine as the sanctimonious but sincere preacher trying to convert the loose woman sadie thompson but in the end loses the battle something i wish was shown but then it was n't in the play or book so i should n't expect it,0
in the grand tradition of bfilms the heroine was the only one who showed any signs of promise with the rest of the cast displaying community theater performances,0
the story what there is of it centers on nick and julie atkins a couple whose marriage of many years is beginning to grow stale,0
this is a very quirky interesting piece and i will be looking for anything else made by the same team,0
that 's all we need,0
an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends,0
but if you 're going to have a movie that 's walltowall clichs at least give it some charming performances to breathe some life into it,0
i could not really feel sorry for these two,0
this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name random hobos a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names,0
as lucille ball rachel york does a commendable job,0
and why is the female deputy running around in a skimpy top,0
leelee sobieski does no harm here however her charm and kind performance do not fit a twotiming character like samantha,0
as good as the boys are there are other staples to contend with which would be an ongoing factor throughout many of their 1940s films,0
and he should never have been allowed to direct his own scripts,0
please people if you get to see this movie go and see it,0
englund was doing his best with weak material and zoe trilling has a really great bottom but neither is enough to carry this film,0
could do with some improvements,0
this is a movie that only liberals in hollywood could produce,0
i thought it was all very contrived and elements of the movie are a blend of others done before all meant to push forward a modern tolerant society alternative lifestyle movement,0
my daughter who is 6 could not even stay awake through it and it is probably the first movie ever she had no desire to watch again,0
things just happen for little reason characters are n't that likable and the dialogue in certain scenes is n't up to much,0
we know from the beginning he is hiding things from the people in the boat but at the same time he offers their only salvation,0
overall i found the story to be realistic and very compelling by not glorifying war,0
worth watching for gielgud and the cars but be prepared to watch a lot of awful acting and directing in the meanwhile,0
each scene is so natural and revealing that it keeps you asking for more,0
it would be a love story between a man and a mermaid,0
throughly entertaining and way underrated imho,0
a handsome older short asian actor,0
i recommend it if you need to laugh or if you 're just lonely and need to watch a romance if you yourself ca n't participate in one,0
i wanted so badly to have her back do n't get me wrong the episode where cordelia comes back is fantastic but i was still really mad she was gone,0
spoilers for example nick cage 's character is a widower who has lost his faith in life,0
i only just watched this film for the first time,0
dallas has the dubious distinction of being deemed a mega metropolis so now just like los angeles and new york there are crack baby cases too numerous to count low cost housing neighborhoods from hell and budgets cuts that will mean there will be a significant number of people who will be dead by this time next year,0
please for the love of god stop talking,0
at his dental practice feinstone 's first patient of the day is young jody saunders there for his very first dental appointment,0
after a while i forgot about it until last night it was on again,0
the performances did nothing to engender the glowing reminiscence of movies watched when i was a child,0
actually was anyone involved with this total disaster thinking at all,0
in addition the thing that really makes this special worth watching is the score especially little birdie and linus and lucy,0
he makes it look like he 's working with something big and largescale but otherwise that 's not the case and a small little universe is created,0
however joe betrays the trust of the man he is working with living with and was engaged to the daughter of and instead just goes over to the bar to visit bertie,0
it is funnier more brutal and more disgusting than the original,0
but still a thrill ride,0
if you are not familiar with commercial indian cinema the acting may seem like it is a bit over the top but here the entire cast especially the leads shows tremendous restraint,0
i could n't finish watching it and i guess nobody in his right mind would unless he 's desperate to see gay porn,0
he manages to get them on a trip to the country,0
i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense,0
now on to the story,0
nothing is held back and we see it as feminism in a liberating form they do n't need to cover up and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they 're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex surprise comfort discomfort curiosity motherhood and sadly cancer,0
all logic for this movie is thrown out the window through the glass that is,0
about the cast paresh rawal is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook,0
not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most,0
avoid unless you 're one of the groups i mention above,0
evil altar has very little going for it except for the story which in more capable hands could have been compelling in an epic and gruesome sorta way,0
perhaps the biggest mistake it made was that it tried to cram literally almost everything that was in charles dickens' original novel into the storyline,0
most ideas from retro scifi series especially including star trek has been reused several times this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph,0
everything is pulled together neatly and tightly by mike nichols here and the movie despite the 80 's haircuts and style still gets you going today,0
the action does n't pick up until the last ten minutes of the film,0
the idea of a treasure is a totally victorian imperialist british concept and completely inappropriate for discussing the cultures of the places that this idiot visits,0
i understand it 's one of hitchcock 's least exciting films but i did have a good time watching it,0
the film tells the story of brutal drinker david holm who beats up his wife neglects his children seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse edit,0
it just shows his talents as an actor,0
the first film in the notorious guinea pig series the devil 's experiment is widely controversial but as opposed to many other controversial films this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for,0
he is a totally superfluous prop,0
the whole town returns to normal and business thrives because of the publicity,0
i always hated stephen williams 's directing,0
this is entertaining and it then becomes a big laughing comedy,0
mr hess quickly shuts him down and in a somewhat menacing tone tells him something to the effect of i thought i told you we were n't going to talk about that weird,0
the music from acclaimed composer howard shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere,0
the story plot of this film lacked and the directing and editing were also sub par,0
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,0
if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things then well you are why your audience the average joe will not rent this film and if they do they will write reviews like this,0
that 's what i kept asking myself during the many fights screaming matches swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes,0
in a world where only men are allowed to tread the boards ned 's desdemona is the closest thing 17th century audiences get to femininity in theatre,0
this production is in short a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure,0
part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear though this can be distracting,0
the good to this movie is the location shooting and george sanders gamely taking on the sort of role given to ralph bellamy,0
my warmest thanks to the fine people at milestone for producing this dvd release,0
i know i know plan 9 from outer space is the worst movie or maybe manos the hands of fate,0
this film clearly falls into the garbage category,0
title puzzle fits the film just as well as this is indeed a highly compelling and intelligent puzzle which is capable of stunning the viewer from the first minute,0
the setting could be anywhere in small town america in any working class family yet this film is about a waterman 's family and what they do in a time of crisis,0
there were a couple ridiculous plot points but overall it played out very simply and satisfyingly,0
it was a horrible role to take,0
the volcano blows at the end,0
omar sharif 's mad magician is superb,0
yes it is just that good,0
the characters are not well developed and very little romance actually makes it to the stars,0
the ingredients were there and then some,0
she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant,0
if i had ten thumbs i would give him ten thumbs up,0
spoiler ahead the fun lies in ridiculous moments,0
after seeing this you 'll never watch another low budget movie in the same way again and that 's a good thing,0
it 's about vigilante justice,0
i'm stealing my last comment from comic book guy in the simpsons worst movie ever,0
this series easily adds to the excellent comedies being produced,0
if you watch it expecting something more tongueincheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more,0
i'm looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it it 's very very good,0
last episode added substantial chaos to global plot,0
i just found the entire 3 dvd set at walmart in the bargain bin for 550 so i thought i would take another look,0
hangman is a somewhat interesting thriller with some good things but too many horrible mistakes that completely bury any enjoyment from the viewer and most of all any value the movie could have,0
it was a huge review that showcased the talents of the artist and the director while also giving us a backstage pass to a play many of us probably never heard of,0
october sky is a highly lauded movie and its easy to see why,0
i would love to have a dvd or video of it to share with the four children i now have,0
the costuming the music the cinematography all artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and provided a rich experience,0
it appears that the producers were trying to hurt the official bond franchise,0
the city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff,0
with so many talented actors beginning with mcewan this should have been a very watchable and enjoyable entry,0
as i said this film will move you probably to tears,0
i'm not just saying this to get it through that this movie is a piece of trash i actually mean everything i'm going to say,0
i do not necessarily believe that shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion but i hated this movie,0
the second story is about some mean teens killing an indian for no reason at all and stealing his peace pipe and getting high off of it,0
in both films conrad manages to find a sweet and hilarious humanity in bad days or bad weeks or bad years,0
this movie had made me dislike street fighter,0
there was n't any sweet romance in it but rather something else,0
she tries to make her daughter seem the best in front of others and tells her off for each little mistake,0
if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk then you know what 's in store with scream baby scream,0
the performances are all good the story has compelling moments and all scenes seem beautifully filmed a pretty good epic western drama,0
that 's about the only redeeming quality in a movie that otherwise insults the viewer 's intelligence by losing track of time plot and reason for being produced,0
the first two thirds of sunshine were fair,0
art film is one thing but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people it becomes a selfdestructive joke,0
the idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes,0
interestingly isaac is a paraplegic confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents,0
tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act,0
also the jokes about being a washed up coach who through the course of the movie encourages the team to fail in school and later runs from the police in his underwear have been done before,0
i was to say the least pleased,0
this is a beautifully constructed film on a sensitive subject,0
the killer are very menacing almost like it 's a game to maim and murder anyone who crosses their territory,0
some animation sequences provide creative transitions of scenes,0
while the danson version is superior to any previous film it does not replace the book,0
this movie screams to be made fun of,0
glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now,0
the depth of power of his heart and eyes is so overwhelming as to be almost too great to bear i think my heart will burst under the load save that he carries me with my light yoke,0
buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout and in fact got drawn back into crime,0
but it does show the whole spectrum of humanity,0
the designer is encouraged to join a group of people who 've had near death experiences,0
obviously this is unintended as this tries to be edgy erotic and smart,0
so 2 different types of spiders,0
it 's too bad done right this could have been a classic,0
it 's in a class of its own yet it has an international potential,0
however there has only been a few adaptations of it and most are mediocre and childish,0
all the time but of course it was a really young winona ryder,0
the sets make the sealed room look very staged,0
even though her character makes some mistakes in the beginning she has a big heart and lots of love for her beloved daughter,0
is it 100 accurate and is it a little sappy in places,0
into this dysfunction comes jennifer stewart as a young cousin from chicago who upsets the strange family chemistry that has been developing over the years befriending the poor kids and catching a lot of eyes,0
sadly not even mr nero or sho kosugi could n't make this film watchable,0
joyce 's eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy it offers many wildly perverse episodes,0
and then the genuinely scary stuff starts,0
i did n't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie,0
only one scene stood out for me in this movie and that was when the realtor backs out of the driveway after leading the family to their new home accidently knocking over a tombstone to which she yells damn tombstone,0
there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy even dark comedy in that aspect,0
i love anthology style horror films and have been searching for the best ones for a long time,0
its totally up to date with any metal music out there now if not better,0
this movie however stands far below cache and code unknown in the haneke repertoire,0
i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense,0
stalling plays home sweet home at an inappropriately appropriate moment,0
burton is also too old for the part he was only 43 during filming but looks more like 50 i was n't surprised he was amazed to receive yet another undeserved oscar nomination for this garbage not only is the film so terribly acted by its elderly cast but there is nothing good about burton 's awful performance at all,0
not much for a modern scifi horror,0
this is a really excellent black and white film that curiously is n't really about being black or white,0
i especially love the hearse,0
worse than american ninjas 3 with its rubber knives awful acting worse than sickle even why it 's even worse than the thin red line the only reason to watch this film is for comparative purposes if it 's anywhere near the killing edge it is n't worth the time you 'll take to watch it,0
i always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clich 'd horror film,0
after the shock of the new wears off maggie starts to take pride in her job,0
the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really do n't think it 's worth anyone 's time,0
i found the character 's really poor very unlikable the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it 's 85 a half minute too long 86 minute duration,0
this was a wonderfully shot movie too bad the acting plot and direction were below average,0
but here he 's pretty much a carbon copy of alvin,0
at one wonderful point in the film a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him but she stands very firm and forces them to back down,0
is this movie worth seeing,0
with the exception of a couple of major errors the cast is wonderful,0
the movie was clichd shallow and lacking in creativity humor or cleverness,0
the 80 's were really the decade to live in,0
you begin to feel keane 's pain and anguish,0
this plot twist just does n't make sense kirsten had managed to get the whole household suspicious of her so much so that her fianc had asked her to leave the house so why kill her,0
you can not feel the power in the movie,0
every actor fit their character beautifully,0
yet from it 's opening sequence in which mentally retarded sam is left on the street corner to care for his newborn daughter on his own this thing grabbed me,0
director robert florey does a quality job behind the lens and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving a particularly good turn as the blind girl,0
scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen but the camera does n't hesitate to linger on their corpses,0
and off cause get 's involved in something he thought he could leave behind him,0
the only thing remotely decent about this film is the animation but that 's about it,0
also shame on wyatt smith for editing the film in such a way,0
that 's known to be hazardous to your health,0
as a result the last hunt is an interesting and entertaining film very well made but falling short of what would be needed to consider it a classic,0
others might appreciate the cinematography but this is definitely not for everyone,0
however the one thing that gets me and why they have n't returned it to the original film track is the dubbing of ava gardner 's voice,0
the murdered firefighters rescuers office workers bystanders and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics,0
i assume they would first try to investigate quietly,0
the puzzles are still welldone and this can be challenging and should satisfy a decent range of people with three difficulty settings,0
you could see them wanting to make a joke but no one in the audience laughed,0
the film has other faults as well,0
the film would be inherently fascinating even if it were no good but there 's actually a lot here of genuine interest,0
wherever my legs take me is his reply,0
but you know what they say about those who assume it makes an ass out of u and me,0
david and sarah had narrowly escaped from these menacing enemies and found a peaceful place in paradise to spend their time,0
updated remake of george romero 's 1968 classic has better makeup and special effects than it 's predecessor,0
it 's as if someone took the characters in the first movie and put them on a faster time machine with all that fast talk,0
it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man,0
my first thought was how in the world am i going to be able to beat that,0
then she meets a mysterious man follows him to france and gets involved with a terrorist group plotting to kill several people,0
despite all of this it is still a very good production,0
this movie despite what many reviewers seem to think is about the differences between men and women with respect to sex and love,0
it 's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone though so i decided i could n't live with myself unless i gave it a chance,0
the leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a rattlesnake 's and how he appeared to smile while growling,0
the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string oneliners after oneliners,0
my favorite parts were when the kids would have some reason to break into the plant like a kid 's version of tom clancy 's rainbow six almost,0
this is a gamble but i think it pays off to a degree by allowing one to sympathize if not identify with strieber,0
this film is a truly underrated classic,0
the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party and from there tristan befriends sebastian cole who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld,0
it 's just possible that perkins really does just want things to go boom,0
to sum it up it 's a scifi time travel murder mystery so it gets the best of three genres,0
the plot is simplistic the twists can be seen a mile away and the story itself is uninteresting and bland,0
it looked like it was up there with the office as one of the best recent british comedy series,0
the pic is overlong about two hours and half though is neither boring nor tiring but entertaining because develops many adventures and happenings,0
her uncle art silver gets a notable entertainer eddie sparks to hire her for his ufo show,0
get it if you want to laugh,0
she 's overacting as if she 's in a movie for the first time,0
after a vicious battle austin hits the stunner to retain the title,0
as an entry in the dirty harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments including the legendary go ahead make my day line that eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery,0
it 's now 1950 reunion time,0
i do not honestly understand why so many people think this film is so bad,0
dunn getting fed up with buono 's sinister airs lectures him before leaving that if he is going to wear white he should not eat dishes with tomato sauce,0
the young actress is perfectly cast for the role and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her,0
as a child these depictions of violence never had an affect on me and as an adult i find the cartoon to be more interesting due to the use of classic weapons,0
both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that 's its all acting,0
this movie is absolute excrement and i cannot recommend it for children or adults,0
it comes too early in the film showing us her in this sort of hooray i survived the three ghosts of christmas past dramatic change,0
this is a very funny and sad movie about two girls just entering the real world trying to figure out what to do with life just as seymour a middle aged man struggles through his own life as he has trouble relating to other people,0
colin farrell was totally wooden as was jamie foxx,0
the climax and the ending do n't disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so,0
the film at this point becomes more interesting as the tension mounts,0
matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as oscar a oneofakind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout,0
since it 's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion,0
he showed no expression or emotions most of the time and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy,0
the real talent here is thomas,0
this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back,0
it was relieving to see how these two good persons can come out actually happier in the end,0
please do n't watch this movie unless you are heavily medicated,0
we 're not just talking about little things here either we 're talking about key plot points,0
i had the benefit of seeing this with my mother who hailed from cork and in watching we talked and i learned a lot from her about how things were back then,0
with a strong cast including tony shalhoub and maggie gyllenhaal we assumed this brilliant comedy would at least be moderately funny,0
i bought this movie because the actress on the cover was very good looking and wearing little clothing,0
generally i do n't mind if novels or true stories are changed somewhat in a movie but in this case the original at least had some plot in it and in this poor adaptation simply nothing happens,0
as for the aspects of the film that are n't relative the acting is pretty good,0
i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it,0
its characters were all shallow and superficial its story line far less socially redeeming than a simpsons episode,0
the book is still worth reading even today,0
this is n't just kids playing war but they have ranks follow orders and act much like adults would in war,0
yet somehow it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom,0
and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked,0
the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die,0
it has a plot so basic it was probably thought up in 5 minutes,0
this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value,0
if he were correct about the gas everybody would know about it,0
a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad,0
pie guy finally gets his but we do n't see him get it,0
he is undoubtedly a good actor but as eddie chapman he remains pale and utterly deadpan,0
this film is a master piece and is a must buy dvd,0
while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film it is much better than this tripe,0
nothing is made of the interracial relationship nor the fact that the young man has a black father and white mother,0
and poor robert walker died before its release,0
i 've just finished listening to the director 's commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like mann 's the insider is completely subjective,0
one of the better eighties postapocalyptic films was and is def con 4 it bombed in 1985 but has gone on to gain a small cult following,0
eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to london on their flying bed,0
for example the villain confronts the hero there can only be one big dog everybody else they just sniff while the hero challenges the villain are you all bark and no bite,0
you 're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it,0
though not specified mendelsohn uses enough period cars props and costumes to peg the period to the mid 1980 's which is undoubtedly a recreation of the period when he lived on long island,0
everyone in the state of louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept,0
it may be news to this french director that the california desert is harsh the roadside strip malls soulless but it should n't be news that sex can be soulless,0
top boy in school highflying plans,0
the reason this movie is so much fun is because you know another laugh is just around the corner,0
then the excitement and anticipation of a visible ship was taken away by clouds and fog and a vague vessel,0
where was peta when this happened,0
another factor in the disappointment of this film,0
he 'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes and even lie rather than point out the ugly truth,0
the acting is poor the dialogue is poor the storyline is disjointed and poor,0
no one film will ever please everyone who watched it,0
it must be a triumph when you learn you 've landed philip glass but then you have to get something out of him,0
skillfully directed by john sturges this was his first great success with the western genre,0
i must have seen this film about 15 or so times now,0
so the oscars they won are not really great measuring devices,0
but they tried to do too much,0
most of the time i was left confused and often amused by the overacting,0
i chuckled at this obvious identification of someone spending his free time at the movies and being completely lost in them as a form of escapism from the mundane repetitiveness and perhaps loneliness in his day job,0
seven years later nobody ages and the film goes on,0
the main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to sustain 85 minutes of cinema the sketches do n't have the writing skills of say a charlotte church or ricky gervais to make them funny enough and while it might make desultory late night tv does n't have a hook to get people to queue up in public at multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes,0
why that irritating smug grin throughout the film,0
horrible acting in that scene by the way,0
she ends up with cliff,0
the sets are outstanding and very impressive the idea of a devastating world war starting in the late thirties seems like prophecy for a 1936 film the dictator of everytown is pure mussolini and raymond massey is just charming believable and ideally cast as the hero,0
i know that these parents can act pretty badly push their children too hard and just generally act like a bunch of jerks but it still raises the question of whether it is right to dupe people in top something they are not aware of especially something that they will be judged the rest of their lives for by millions of people,0
but that seems to be the general consensus regarding this film,0
once again the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear,0
though there are some stuff that you 'll miss because you do n't have the background explanation,0
most of the cast are actual soldiers and officers just back from the war,0
i suppose everything does come back to money it 's too bad that there are now no other shows on abc that actually make you feel good after watching,0
the last performance in which lenny is on stage in nothing except a raincoat in particular is eye opening according to the trivia it actually occurred and was sent in by a student who was at the show,0
the best actor was pencil the dog who had the good sense to die early on,0
this is as another comment already stated a truly original movie,0
i 've been unable to verify whether the net information is inaccurate or if the musical performances have been edited into the shows on the dvd,0
slight spoilers maybe some spoilers but it really does n't matter wow,0
please someone one with a tempered style remake this movie,0
do not see this movie,0
sure it brought tears to my eyes,0
the plot suddenly became far too serious compared to the outrageous antics that were on show previously,0
i laughed i cried it was better than cats,0
maybe we should make a commentary about that problem,0
the parts were played well and the kids did a good job bringing the characters to life,0
he makes a valiant attempt a commendable and moving one but his film needs to be seen and understood by all for it to do its ultimate job,0
he readily admits that both he and adamson did not make the kind of movies they would have preferred to make but given the budgets and conditions under which they were compelled to work tried to give their audiences the biggest possible bang for their buck,0
sometimes movies get so bad that they actually pollute the earth,0
some of the scenes are just wonderful one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in david lynch 's elephant man some 29 years later and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is alec guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of stanley but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world,0
but that 's not saying much,0
why are the quality gaythemed films all made by straight writers and directors,0
jimi is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover jack and they live with jack 's obese alcoholic loose morals aunt vanessa and sally 's chubby daughter hannah,0
does i suspect work as a thriller or horror story,0
you know how those educational videos that they show us in school whether you 're in school now or you were in school 20 years ago all look like they were made in the early 1970 's by people being paid in bad polyester suit patches,0
tracy nelson does show real promise as an actress she has a likable and quite bubbly personality and it was a pleasure to see her develop as the series progressed,0
this game is a true gem gorgeous graphics extremely engaging and entrancing story,0
he also covers completely unrelated topics such as dogs drugs family life boxing and sex all the while being hysterically funny,0
sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he 's known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and i consider that a major disappointment,0
one of the advantages of a novel is that it can go in many different directions successfully and work very well because the written word allows for a much fuller depiction of what 's happening,0
what 's the point of lighting the metal point of a spear before you stab someone,0
lucy took this role because she thought it would be fun and good sunday night fare,0
a man and his wife are not getting along because of the wife 's jealousy and drinking problems,0
there 's very few gore dreadful attempts to bring insert humor and truly annoying character drawings,0
i would never want to miss a beat because i would know that my footage could possibly change the way the people of our world think about life in our universe,0
i'm not really sure what else i can say about this movie other than i wish i could recover the the time in my life that i wasted in watching this horrible movie,0
how did he get a hold of the junkie 's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two,0
this is waste of time movie,0
this music is really great,0
the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much downtoearth,0
guys and dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes around the themes of gambling and salvation,0
this is my personal opinion of course and i really did try to see god things in it,0
i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too,0
i'm a huge fan of b movies,0
i do n't understand where all the positive buzz has come from,0
anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one,0
but you start out with a classic romp of a tale that happens to dig a little deeper and discuss some pretty important stuff,0
after watching he 's movies you will find your new fears,0
the characters were vibrant and and nothing short of beings created in your own mind or nightmare,0
no the story held no surprises,0
too bad for this is one of the very best films of the 1980s a decade where more and more slick trash was created and great art like this was without a home,0
green was one of the better ones i 've seen in a while,0
it 's hard not to let this bother you,0
would just like to add that the latest movie to have such an effect on me although not necessarily for the positive has been american beauty,0
and bellamy is so good at playing dumb you have to wonder if perhaps he 's not really in on the joke,0
however it is not all laughs his excellent performance evokes laughter pity and frustration with the ease that we have come to expect from him,0
this one is n't even lively enough to be fun,0
a must see film without a doubt it mirrors your emotions it drives you mad drives you sad and challenges your morality,0
it was meant in good stead but has been overdone,0
this season lacked its usual sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories,0
this one pours it on heavy,0
the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham,0
the ultimately lifeaffirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight this is a picture that provided you get into it you can remember long after it 's over,0
it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters,0
they do n't make movies like this any more,0
instead we get various plotlines that diverges into their own separate little movies,0
this movie teaches about racism whites vs indians indians vs indians and that we should look at the heart,0
bones was utterly horrible but so bad that it was actually funny,0
among the funniest are the scenes where beverly torments her neighbor mink stole with hilariously obscene phone calls to drive her over the edge,0
i'm not someone easily shocked by what filmmakers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor,0
it provokes two reactions and one is called sleep,0
that 's not to say the film is left in want of character complexity however but more that the sheer spectacle of it all can tend to overwhelm its various more subtle aspects,0
if anything it 'll make you smile,0
here the war is n't mentioned but the fact that the film deals with the production of planes at the very least alludes to it,0
a must see for all fans of great noir film,0
since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start,0
of course the black people are killed the bitchy girl is killed the teacher that has a past of sexual harassment with students gets killed yuck yuck yuck,0
that is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly can quickly become grating for adults,0
this film in spite of having a very decent cast goes nowhere in trying to tie in handguns to the intertwined lives of several different people,0
on a second viewing it might be laughable but there 's so much to deal with that the first time around was just a painful exercise in masochism,0
found footage is spliced in with total disregard for what 's around it,0
does not the wind love the dirt,0
was she warned of some danger,0
they provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment,0
it is rare that a story which starts as a million nondescript thrillers have started goes on to involve its people in such a realistic and wellthoughtout series of events,0
well done to farrah for being a golden globe 'best actress' nominee,0
something different from the usual movies and great fun,0
hell this should have had suspense period,0
i'm a highly opinionated and talkative person this movie left me absolutely speechless,0
the character of kim was at minimum suffering from a bipolar disorder,0
the fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool,0
why cherish lee takes of f her overcoat after defeating the reaper,0
no really that about sums up my opinion of this show but i guess i 'll elaborate,0
but the most spellbinding character belongs to christopher plummer who steals every scene he 's in with an astounding take on mike wallace,0
i 've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the gist,0
when he realizes what they have done he forces them to eat the meal themselves,0
and that final catandmouse chase scene is plain old dull,0
unfortunately in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half,0
the film has way too many unrealistic ideas for a so called realistic ghost story,0
now the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid but lacked innovation,0
silly sequel truly a disappointment from a talented horror veteran from whom i expect more than just a runofthemill slasher film which is what this is,0
putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing for which i absolutely have no comprehension,0
nothing is sustained or delivered because they are poorly staged and too goofy to have any sort of effect,0
if the shooting medium is n't dv it 's 16mm,0
better think separately with its head,0
they should be ashamed of themselves,0
one involves a coworker a women apparently worth exploring who law 's character considers,0
the creepiness catches you completely off guard,0
this obviously 40something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow,0
hearing what others had to say i told myself that a movie ca n't be that bad,0
for a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging,0
firstly i understand the need for dramatic licence but this does n't excuse some of the laughable inaccuracies portrayed here,0
the special effect were horrible i had n't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology,0
the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts,0
amanda michalka had her moments when she was n't that terrible,0
the director knows exactly what he 's doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted it,0
best scenes may be the night club sequence when dunne gets stuck dancing with bellamy and the party where dunne pretends to be grant 's sister and yells out hey wait a minute,0
an mgm miniature short subject,0
some mobsters have been buying up the local business 's and they want nash 's club but he wo n't sell,0
it is almost like a child 's color book come to life,0
if you were sitting around your radio you did n't need cgi to visualize the worst that was happening,0
two positive notes the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights and best of all we have the girl side kick actually participating in the mayhem mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys,0
i found myself thinking the same thing since i never walk out before the credits,0
i wanted to marry him,0
it breaks the rules of the spacetime continuum in the way that time seems to reverse itself during the viewing,0
his character hunt stevenson is a likable affable everyman a natural leader with a wiseass streak,0
conrad brooks is in it too so it has to be really bad does n't it,0
then they end up going to bed,0
i get the feeling that when they were making this film they had planned to make a serious horror and after watching it they knew to save face they would have to promote it as a dark comedy,0
yes there is plenty of action but you find yourself wondering how much stranger can this thing get,0
the film is like a day in the life to a certain degree so for those who always were dying to know what this man is like it is extremely exciting for them,0
the actors do a decent job for the most part with some glaring exceptions my true problem with this film is the very basis for which it is based,0
we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed this was n't a work of abysmal film,0
this low budget stinker was an epic fail,0
there appear to be some portions of the unknown missing but the amputation of footage has n't spoiled the film,0
its really fun i do n't know how today audience would react but if you grew up on it or loved the 80s then this is a great film,0
the film seems to take itself a little too seriously as a result ends up being a bit dull,0
in the end he had to choose between her life and his own,0
in plot line deadgirl owes a lot to river 's edge in that a group of teens without pity or any sense of decency abuse a corpse and refuse to divulge the information to anyone of authority,0
california dreaming is just a big old mess,0
the technique used here for the asides is another problem,0
little edie blames her mother for her current state and her mother fires back that edie was never going to be the success she thought she was,0
as a thriller it rises above most of its peers with competent editing and a chilling score effectively providing an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere,0
the sync is perfect in every shot,0
chris pine makes quite an impression as funloving brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other wellknown actress piper perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role,0
in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream this broke the mold,0
sure its atmospheric but if you do a remake of a movie it needs to have a solid story and echo simply does n't,0
it 's hidden on lynch 's website and well worth the search,0
also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary,0
there is not a single part in the film which could be left out,0
although the movie was supposed to be about little tree 's education we learn almost nothing about it,0
some critics have compared the showdown between professor x and magneto with the rivalry between martin luther king and malcolm x during the turbulent 1960s while others have recognized mutants as symbols of any oppressed group forced to identify themselves whether they be classified as homosexuals communists jewish or firearms owners,0
the performances by the actors were fun,0
bicentennial man was an excellent movie it was great for children and adults,0
the landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation are undercooked and certainly didnt help move the plot any further,0
there 's an actual 6 minute long monologue about how the old vampires cannot breath the toxic air that exists today and how they are bloody angry about not being able to drink the blood of people with hiv cause it will make them sick,0
i feel that they are well written and have substance,0
it looks like the studio was counting every buck making the movie and no one actor and no one character from the original movie did n't return for the sequel,0
i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie,0
are they really a big name act,0
but this is a slow sick and deadly dull movie,0
the atmosphere makes this movie everything that it is,0
the site is in english french and german and hotel rates are pretty reasonable as are ticket prices,0
only without the annoying theme song,0
she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects but not really enough to add to the validity of the film,0
i mean who thought of sylvester stallone and sharon stone together,0
the acting was extremely thin,0
time jumps can work if the script is topdrawer which this one is not,0
fascinating i approached i am curious and it 's companion piece with great trepidation,0

one idea cronenberg would not get away with today is the lift scene in which a mother and her young daughter are confronted by an infected man,0
the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details,0
montand gives a good performance if somewhat dry and he is well supported by the other actors,0
suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows 237 is thalluri 's attempt to bring it to light,0
i do n't think i 've seen every episode but i still enjoyed it,0
he must have had a mental lapse of the skills he had acquired while filming this or he just sold the filmmakers his name to put on the credits but one of the two must have happened,0
i used to actually leave the pub ten minutes before closing and run down the road to catch it,0
meeting greta garbo gives him a last chance at redeeming his life,0
in real life usually with a little rest the lameness clears up but not in this film,0
it is a very weak drama about a young couple who go out into the wilderness looking for a friend that lives there,0
the film is painfully slow with some incredibly bad performance by the cast who seemed to working with dialogue and without any genuine emotion to their grief,0
however as the season progresses the show gets remarkably better,0
if you watch the opening scene and do n't mind what you see watch this film,0
why is it that when there is a great series on tv possibly a big movie screen version someone decides to end it,0
after the mayhem is over though a very happy ending is taking place,0
looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer geoffrey reeve,0
i thought it would be a descent film about grams life and music but they had to make a film about his death,0
i ca n't submit this without 10 lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer,0
this is a great film that should be seen by everyone,0
the idea that she would do this by simply calling one of them up and annoying him is,0
the way leader baron recruits carson at the start of the movie is beyond ridiculous,0
over and over again to myself,0
if her mother was that bothered why did she never get suspicious when jack friar never returned,0
now i know that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these,0
it is a must see for people who like clean suspense movies,0
the tone of this film is very different from the first,0
did n't rambo do that too,0
just get the steven spielberg version it 's not all that good but it 's 10 times better than this,0
pam grier is sorely missed though,0
to which jenny replies that makes me awfully happy ken,0

it seems that sir ronald and his friends had been instrumental in defeating a brutal plan of von bruno 's in africa three years previously involving slavery and ivory,0
you think this would be important yet kirk who is in contact with the government agents never relays this information to them,0
however the raw honesty of the film somehow manages to become even more shocking than the plot or characters,0
but there 's an entirely different kind of crummy moviemaking that actually came to mind as a contrast to henry and june while i was watching this and that was moulin rouge,0
not really a scary film some bits may make you jump but it needs a little bit of thinking to understand the film properly but it is good do n't get me wrong,0
by taking the same offbeat exaggerated approach to make this film the director is trusting our ability to grasp the essence of his intentions and we should be thankful for such filmmakers who have enough faith in their audience to take chances with a deliberately creative offering,0
it makes the film feel larger,0
it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched,0
like another reviewer said this movie is not a heavy melodrama but it deals with harsh realities,0
then there is rimmer and prude sort of fellow who has always wanted to become an officer but not being able to due to being a complete incompetent worker and a general nuisance to be around has convinced himself that he is a great worker but has not been promoted due to being so good at what he does,0
they definitely thought it was unusual but they seemed to enjoy the characters and situations and had a lot of interested questions about what was going on,0
i wanted to vomit with rage at the stupidity of the character,0
i remember watching the trailer to it on the teenage mutant ninja turtles ii secret of the ooze vhs tape,0
her organs are generally failing and she 's coming home to die,0
action scenes out of the saturday serials,0
well the scifi channel keeps churning these turkeys out and they seem to get worse every time,0
or dr dread who 's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies,0
because the only redeemable quality in this film is jason lee,0
this is not me 'not getting it',0
in short though the sheer complexity of the series means that if you miss out on a few episodes you 've missed out on a lot,0
granted the finale is a visual treat and the aliens do look realistic but it 's surprisingly dissatisfying,0
in spanish with english subtitles,0
lets say when you get done watching it you 'll never cry again,0
this is not a nice film,0
even if it were it would still be engrossing and disturbing crafted with care and with a fantastic soundtrack,0
the story a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals,0
but lana turner diane varsi russ tamblyn terry moore barry coe mildred dunnock lloyd nolan leon ames and hope lange give enormously sensitive performances that will live with me for a long time,0

the actors are not convincing they lack emotions,0
grease has truly become an american icon,0
i 've always had a sneaking suspicion that jack warner saw how well mgm did with two weeks with love a nostalgic gaslight era musical that starred jane powell,0
mr woods captured the soul of this man and knows what he is up to,0
without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work,0
rocky v has become somewhat of a curiosity to me,0
hans will return as a nazi officer and he 'll be the force that destroys the happiness of this trio and who at the end has to pay for the horrible things he did in his youth,0
i ca n't recall when i 've seen a movie more badly in need of a plot,0
from the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons,0
how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel,0
it took me a while to figure out who the hero was,0
for example the old hippy,0
i can hear the director we paid for the thing we 're gonna film it,0
he has beautiful imagery in his films it 's just that they also tend to have some story lacking,0
ok brooks i'm through with you and i start with leslie nielsen whom i 've never liked,0
i would n't watch it on free cable tv,0
in simulated battle of course,0
it 's all here he tells one of his faithful companions aretha 's dog nino,0
there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer 's crimes,0
it 's nothing short of boxoffice fraud i know but i maintain that this movie had at least a chance to be above average before coming up far short,0
it was satisfying to see such an expert adaptation but especially so to see how the central point of the story has not been lost the inability of any ruler however powerful to control what happens at the end of the long chain of command that inevitably forms,0
i did n't have much faith in this movie when i bought the dvd but it was cheap and i figured it had to contain at least a couple of scares,0
the director should n't express her opinion as truth,0
brad pitt was quite right at the end i do n't know who did it,0
with all the controversy surrounding this film 's central scene these days i was expecting a piece both crude and violent,0
the main three actors here are all in very good form which helps give the movie an unusual lift in quality,0
you could n't have gotten miss stanwyck into a fat suit,0
i absolutely despise this movie,0
the camera work is excellent because it shows only that much which would make you eager to peep beyond the camera frame to see what is there and that keeps you engaged,0
the result is a dreamy masterpiece,0
the female that slept w terrance howard was gorgeous also,0
despite the fact that there was a comparison to shaun of the dead on the cover of this i watched it anyway,0
what on earth was oceans 12,0
it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boring,0
i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act' something i did n't understand,0
it did n't really look that way from the previews but it is,0
initially sides seem to be taken along gender lines but that reverses as each member of the separating couple finds new relationships,0
perhaps with such a future there should be more angst,0
the veteran tim robbins delivered a good even if subtle performance as the older soldier who 's life becomes upside down,0
we start this story after the end of the first snow white,0
it has taken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age between son and father and between defiance and acceptance of religious values,0
i can not believe who is able to drag the good old lucky luke dalton comics so through the mud,0
it 's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it 's undoing since it affords dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap,0
how many times i have to be astonished by that,0
it is a supremely bad movie whose very badness is not the redeeming quality it usually is,0
the acting was the real effect,0
this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive,0
be mindful of a limit,0
of course there were a few good things it was always fun to see lady tremaine appear on the screen and when she left you wished she would come back and the movie would be entertaining enough for a child but it sadly does n't even scratch the surface of the true classic the original disney 's cinderella,0
i would recommend this movie to anyone,0
for example when bison was trying to show the camera that he had a picture of his wife and daughter which were dear to him first off would bison do this,0
one could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half,0
having been a faithful asterix fan all of my life i have to say that asterix and the vikings is probably the most well done of all the asterix films,0
franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members,0
it plays to the most obnoxiously selfcongratulatory nature of people concerned with the issues presented here while at the same time offering nothing of any real substance,0
i totally understand why without spoiling anything the overall message of the movie is shocking,0
there 's also the issue of the warden at the prison,0
8 out of 10 stars watch it now,0
there is only one thing missing there 's no soundtrack and the music is great,0
one reviewer accuses him of being a ham and overacting,0
although mcnichol works overtime being effervescent and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing,0
add to this the fact that it 's punctuated with moments of unnecessary tasteless violence and you have a fairly unsatisfying product,0
winterbottom had an important story with quite a big potential,0
there 's no character development at all,0
i rate this as one of the best movie of the year,0
i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script,0
each story is presented with ordinary people displaying qualities of evil and depravity,0
in spite of playing fast and loose with fact this is a beautifully acted and touching film,0
an all time classic this should have won best picture not kramer vs kramer,0
conclusion sure go watch this movie if nothing you 'll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was,0
we sat in disbelief as we waited for a joke to come or possibly this movie to even get better but no,0
its so nice to see this wonderful film again and i actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on dvd,0
a bit long but worth it,0
i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus 3 at least that movie had better reviews on this site,0
the story starts to get confusing at this point,0
i should really have said two saving graces frederic forrest earned his oscar nomination here,0
the movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one though the right intentions are definitely there,0
all of these guys are under the spell of a handful of horror classics from the '60 's and 70 's and they seek to further develop these films and their concepts,0
if it is incomprehensible then it cant be really bad and who knows it might be great,0
how all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie not to be missed,0
and why did it have to play in the middle of the day,0
unfortunately the story does n't match the cinematography,0
my advice is if you ever decide to watch this film do n't,0
the kid was terrible talking to himself doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and kicking a porcupine,0
fat ugly people who just do n't like being with other people,0
the original lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre,0
i am always looking for a lot of laughs and for nice places in which to live at least for an hour or so,0
this is how rainer acts throughout the film,0
this is one of the worst movies ever made with no inspiration or craftsmanship whatsoever,0
second does the movie sell the message that if you work hard you will succeed no matter what and does that message tell the truth about success in america,0
why were they bouncing on balloons for 15 minutes,0
perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on,0
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes,0
great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional,0
saw this one last week,0
a short review but avoid at all costs a thorough waste of 90mins,0
hitch treats us to a huge menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction,0
hopefully they will feature the original cast,0
to my surprise it was a parody and a clever one at that,0
but karloff who is the theater 's doctor sees foster,0
lackawanna blues is a drama through and through,0
rex ingram was a great actor and he was inspiring in each of his roles in this film,0
major disappointing swashbuckling romantic film with the great ronald colman playing 2 parts a cousin who goes to zenda to attend his cousin 's coronation only to be involved when the monarch is kidnapped,0
had this been treated with more care and a bit more seriously in the right places this could have been a great comedy but as is this one fails on all levels it does not teach it does not ponder and it does not entertain,0
if there was ever an example of a wrong happy ending this would be it,0
the big weak spot though is in the intertitles,0
santa claus is a blackmailer and his christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee nazis on the lam,0
it 's always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long,0
the female lead takes her role very seriously and gives a convincing emotional and physical performance,0
i only saw it when it came onto cable,0
a kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike stephen king 's the shining,0
for some reason this kind of sentimentality is lately acceptable in war movies but rarely elsewhere,0
brendan filone shall strike back,0
i believe hildegarde withers is the greatest of all the old lady snoops in mystery novels and films and that includes miss marple and jessica fletcher,0
one final observation unlike many of the straighttovideo movies being churned out today htd actually has some decent production standards,0
occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is hunting them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement,0
it has some great heavyweights,0
the characters are also extremely well developed,0
not a balanced point of view,0
it 's basically a must see for any fans of the cky crew,0
for me the absolute low point came several years ago when a popular young male actor i liked a lot was the guest host,0
in the end the day is saved by the dud and he settles in by somehow managing to get a whole ship of women under his charm,0
oh well let me get back to the game at hand,0
quincy jones has penned a beautifully melodic score and also provided some original blues for the occasion,0
he had some great lines but i agree with the reviewer who commented on his age being a bit of a distraction,0
moore as dolemite is either funny cool or both,0
they can settle in palestine only by the goodwill of the arabs,0
in an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers puerile comedies or awesome special effects both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development,0
the songs save for one are all forgettable and i doubt the one that is ok will leave its mark too,0
but on the other hand footprints commands respect for the fact that it does n't just follow on from what went before it,0
please do not waste one moment of your time watching this film,0
the working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father,0
a few minutes in not credible,0
no hollywood bs no explosions no corny one liners film,0
i'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money,0
coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery,0
the first part of the movie is slightly scary but as the movie goes along and things happen this movie turns into a huge mystery,0
in most cases they have nothing to do with trolls,0
anderson so far has n't made a bad movie and so i hope that he does n't disappoint with fantastic mr fox,0
and kari please start acting in some better films,0
using an overhead camera that shows masses of people standing as the ship pulls away the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and those waving goodbye from the dock and the way they are separated implies they are being torn asunder from everything familiar,0
the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable,0
but allen also has too much warmth going on in humor as well as his affection for the upfront plastic appeal of 30s movie characters and atmosphere to make things sour for too long,0
not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless unnecessary nature footage,0
i think that people should be allowed to explore the darkest sides of their shadows without shame but the desire to eat another human and the desire to be eaten are not sexual perversions they are severe mental illnesses,0
it 's only slightly different than young boys performing the female roles in shakespeare 's plays,0
however here comes the part that just does n't ring true,0
from then on i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season only a little better,0
to be fair though he is attractive and pleasing to watch during the sex scenes,0
that fog machine and the spotlight behind the trees must have been pretty damn expensive,0
the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut 1999 full metal jacket 1987 barry lyndon 1975 a clockwork orange 1971 2001 a space odyssey 1968 spartacus 1960 and many more,0
so if you have any decency left in you,0
when nobody returns to the kingdom from the battle the king renders the land of battle cursed and forbids anyone from going there,0
matthew mcconaughey really surprised me because he has played this role before without conviction,0
in other words hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch,0

i'm watching it now 20 years later and it 's still a very good story,0
if you 're anything like me you 're already predisposed to liking the movie just by reading that much about the premise,0
in the worst years of the depression the most popular stars were not the most glamorous or attractive,0
i couldnt believe how well this kid did on screen you will completely forget that they are actors and loose yourself in the movie,0
barry is a guy who gets all the wrong breaks in life and has a very bad temper which he just simply cannot control,0
then suppose hook decided not to kill peter but to steal his son 's affections instead,0
i would advise anybody against watching this film prefer the first one or the original aliens or the original predator films but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time on this failure,0
black and white photos sound bite interviews and a somewhat monotonous narration,0
the editing tries to save it but with that very bad material in hands they ca n't do miracles,0
his journey to downtown new york goes hideously wrong when he loses his taxi fare and spends the rest of the evening trying to get home,0
but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact,0
this movie is best watched among a group of your closest 80 's friends,0
even though none of them are especially unattractive the outside world appears to treat them like they are,0
the failure to do this ultimately spoiled a perfectly good premise for a film,0
the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly,0
how would they react to nevsky,0
acting gets worse as the show goes on,0
i would n't be giving up on my true love so soon,0
i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable,0
for me the film became a joke and i could n't wait for the end to arrive so i could leave,0
but where the movie was good for me it was bad in a lot of other places,0
i think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it,0
someone is killing some punks and harry gets dragged into this situation where he meets jennifer spencer a woman with a secret that the little tourist town wants to keep quiet,0
he 's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world,0
i ca n't tell if it 's yesterday or tomorrow and it 's a real mind f this single quote from laura dern sums the movie up fairly well,0
the action sequences in the film are well choreographed however the story drags during the middle of the film,0
he is introduced to everyone and everything,0
these shorts work as the format allows chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments,0
there was a rumour about an interview between him and yutte if anyone knows more,0
american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa,0
this is a grand achievement,0
in fact the oblivious boy has no idea that something suspicious is afoot despite several odd circumstances that arise,0
i admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline,0
quite well made on a certain level but there are so many more better films out there in this genre,0
this is nazi exploitation at its most mediocre,0
i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story either,0
the hookers was to me a great everyday people story like someone you might have known,0
the plot of the film is absurd,0
but the most interesting were the dialogs,0
you really will have trouble following what is going on,0
to my delightful surprise bridget fonda gave a stellar effort because she did n't put on lazy acting as if it 's just another film project that pays her money big kudos to her,0
you wo n't see many movies teaming with this much humanity much less one that spends most of its time in the housing projects of east new york brooklyn,0
it does n't take a clairvoyant to see where this is headed,0
honestly i find this film almost too depressing for my own good,0
instead i think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place,0
it was heartbreaking disturbing and inspiring all in one,0
maybe they know some things i do n't about 007 maybe i 've been missing something about the character,0
meanwhile molly is getting pretty fed up with hawks treatment of her and after a showdown where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old hen the stage is set for murder,0
in some ways this movie has haunted me ever since,0
it certainly does n't help that her mother is often gone to denver and when she is home the tensions of the distant relationship with her husband are quietly manifested as robin watches with her worried faintly melancholy eyes,0
i want them to be a bit more serious than that even though they do n't have to be good,0
you could n't see into his eyes at all,0
she starts in the chorus and runs late one day,0
this is what wajda manages,0
not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong,0

there are n't elaborate sets just found locations around the indianapolis area,0
worse there are so few scenes that i watched and considered to be meant to be funny,0

the two are extremely underrated and sadly because of that have to headline a lot of crap,0

i think it 's one of the best lovecraft adaptations ever made,0
the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg blonde venus is a film that looks great while it 's playing but fails to engages the viewer,0

i started watching this series with keen anticipation,0
brilliant script brilliant idea perfect cast great film,0

of course only a few minutes into the film and you ca n't but realize how awful it is and all of a sudden the title does n't sound that funny anymore,0
michael biehn is made of wood really,0
kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went and where even rats would have thought twice,0
it was that they started the movie my complaint lies we 're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john landis clive barker and even stephen king make cameos,0
with a script that 's just plain stupid and a clueless directing the whole point of the film is silly,0
the pacing of the middle section is very slow,0
yes it looks great all expensive commercials do,0
i advise that after viewing this film a good month to regain senses and sanity,0
martin dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they 're all better than this and it 's quite painful watching them work with such thin material,0
now that would be considered torture if most guys did n't consider it a turnon,0
other than the opening scene where hyde has about five minutes of screen time we see him for less than 10 seconds in the rest of the film,0
what 's wrong with this film,0
i really could see this being successfully remade in cgi,0
quite poorly i might add,0
because the director was so concentrated to shoot the beautiful landscape in outback,0
i really liked this one,0
for some odd reason 7th heaven even aired here in austria,0
what a startling piece of originality,0
ultimately the whole film amounts to little more than sour grapes by letterman fans who just cannot accept that the better comic was chosen by people whose business it is to know these kind of things,0

we follow the life in silence of the monks in the grande chartreuse monastery in the french alps,0
apart from the obvious reasons,0
you can see the plot points coming a mile away and it clearly plays to the teenage ta crowd,0
this movie is truly a very good movie,0
this movie is loaded with screwball comedy and it shows gene wilder at his most manic,0
it 's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically note for examples the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery,0
there are one or two bad things about this movie well not bad just minor like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which does n't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic,0
so here is your cultural backdrop now the movie has its own little merits but the underlying total lie and poor director 's thinking and probably general grasp of the subject make the better parts totally worthless,0
go see it and love it,0
sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do,0
we begin when the shogunate is on its last legs but still capable of punishing its enemies,0

and i do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from thora birch,0
ving rhames really played the part and played the part well,0
emotions are shown without preparation or care and we are left without any means of relating to these cardboard figures shadows as they are of american stereotypes,0
i just wish that tom would get the girl for once,0
like 999 of all of bakshi 's films this one incorporates animation and liveaction,0
there is nothing left to even try to save,0
at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish,0
some ca n't even come close to it,0
and in my opinion this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far outdid the book,0
the story is strange and the way to present it is even stranger,0
that is until babette cooks them one of her exquisite meals,0

from the creators of apex just as bad this film has an 18 certificate god knows why,0
she probably enjoys pretending but you wonder when she goes out in public where is her selfawareness for herself and her material,0
everything else is stupid or boring,0
some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny such as dom deluise as bernie the agent and steve martin as the insolent waiter,0
but i paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster,0
i hope to get back to see the film a second time,0
the cast is outstanding the children in particular kate maberly as mary lennox above all,0
this time his main target is the son of a man who just but the elm street house,0

the acting is the equivalent of a 6 year old at the very best,0
if you are a fan of scoobydoo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog along with the jokes that come with it,0
but despite these negatives the music is good the gore is plenty and ranges from silly putty to really good appliances,0
so i'm giving nothing away when i say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she 's kidnapped,0
this movie has been able to give a very good idea of what life in congo in the late fifties and early sixties was like and should be seen by everybody who is interested in the history of the country,0
personally i 'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke until i finally saw castle in the sky,0
as in the real story the nazis gave in one of the rare almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda,0

did this even make it to the cinema,0

there brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship,0

shemp has the opportunity to inherit 500000 from his dead uncle,0
and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city,0

this was my favorite movie at age 36 and it did not scare me or confuse me at all,0
and although it tells a true story that takes place in wwii it is amazingly apropos to the ugly things happening in europe today,0
this is what gives a movie depth and something to think about in my view,0
i first watched the movie with a friend who had seen it at school and she loved it so much she shared it with me,0
the native scenes are gorgeous both in the scenery and in the relationships portrayed,0
as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success,0
sure it 's a funny little detective show that can occasionally be downright clever in its plots and dialogue,0
gotta start with ed furlong on this one,0
it seem like the director is saying that the industry is not closed people make it on their own talent,0
in short and up front i loved it and it scared me,0
a nightmare from the past,0
but wherever it was filmed it looked great,0
the list of criminals however has much more meat to chew on and does so lead by the villainous leader everett sloane and his deputy ted de corsia as well as all the others to be listed,0
and so to conclude unless you are a immature or a kid do n't watch or stop watching this circus on tv and chose other tv shows instead,0

independent movie making has once again reached a new level,0
one of the best i 've seen,0
so the film starts off with the genre of action adventure film,0
many of dialogues are slow and meaningless,0
i'm not sure how accurate that is but it made me curious first time i heard it described,0
for many viewers this film was spoilt by advertising that showed a movie full of spying hacking and big mysteries,0
both films are violent but i guess it 's the way the russian underworld works,0
it 's not sophisticated but it works,0
unfortunately cimarron is n't all that great a film and i actually like the big trail more due to the scope of the film,0
one of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard,0
instead laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor,0
all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie dickenson looks positively mortified except for rain phoenix who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is,0

also the histrionics of the don 's wife were on the spears or madonna level as described elsewhere here,0
that was by far the crappiest piece of junk i have ever tortured my senses with,0
but it goes badly as the duo mix like oil and water mostly due to each having a strong personality and owen 's huge shoulder chip,0
however it is the creepy minor characters mrs bender an unhinged babysitter and sam stone a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind,0
another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted just like in the omen,0
the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake,0
a very big help would have been a cameo appearance from christopher reeve as superman who is nowhere to be seen,0
but over the years i 've grown to accept zombi 3 i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room,0
i think i made it through about half of this movie,0
he sites profane literature a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible,0
i thought the acting was terrible the story line less than plausible and the characters totally unlikeable,0
the dumbing down of current films means that the delicious innuendo in design for living would go over the head of most of today 's audience,0
kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor,0
i liked how his grandpa told him to screw em,0
eight different characters eight different perspectives,0
the draw of the first half makes it all worthwhile to me it 's just berserk rip taylor screaming and throwing fake snow around while photographing a topless extra from jesus christ superstar,0
there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading,0
it 's most similar to a feature length episode of aussie kids favourite round the twist but it takes itself too seriously to have even that redeeming feature,0
so my advice is to buy a whitney houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise and then rent no way out which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious but far more plausible performance from costner,0
there are a bunch of great songs in this movie so good at being bad you should never talk to strangers blue in the green you wo n't be there in the morning the man without a heart my favorite quote king you do n't love anything do you,0

the only characters in the film who are not total morons from the beginning are john malkovich and his wife tilda swinton,0
the whole film occurs at night,0
the acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script i am guessing,0
what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace,0
add to that the many abrupt revelations the absence of thrills on any level flat characters in general and towards the end a religious revelation to please the religious viewers and you 've got a movie that offers extremely little besides disappointment,0

upside forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives,0
though the solution to the main character 's epilepsy is lifted straight out of howard hawks' el dorado the script is solid pretty fresh and unpretentious,0
some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from it 's wounds,0
the film ca n't even decide its tone with the first ten minutes being legitimate supernatural horror to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller,0
post white heat and jimmy still has a fresh arsenal 1 year later,0
the book usually brings out nuances that the movie cannot really show,0
i think the bone snatcher should go after anyone associated with this movie,0
in fairness jerry o'connell jordana brewster jeremy sisto julia stiles and charles s dutton give their material the old college try but they 're wasted it 's undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton and rosanna arquette is always welcome,0
she was a lovely young woman but way out of place here,0
it got very confusing when they switched scenes,0
i would n't waste my money to see it again if i knew before how sorry it was,0

try to understand he does n't care,0
first off i am in my mid 40 's,0
kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it,0
i enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town and the way that the gremlins just take over,0
i rate this dvd a perfect 1010,0
a terrible script and bad bad acting,0
well the video store which i frequent did not have a copy so it took me six months to finally go somewhere else and rent it,0
when i walked into blockbuster the main focus was on this movie so i decided rent it,0
to add insult to injury these scenes are the best in the entire film,0
for all action fans a must see you wont be disappointed,0
it is a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie this one is no exception,0
the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces,0
i had n't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now i can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie,0
if you you does n't know your eyes are not open my friends you must see it and appreciate wake up,0
while some of the veteran actors gave decent performances the material seemed more shallow than the la socialites the film was following,0

and this while watching it in the dead of night alone with the lights off,0
but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown blackgloved masked figure,0
that did n't explain the awkward editing the jumping from one point in the time line to another the not knowing what was real and what was imagined nor the confusing film in general,0
however i do n't think that could have been good for scully 's baby,0
her happiness is just a mask she wears to avoid realize how much she feels bad about what she is missing for a real family with children,0
i would spoil it if i said more,0
well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven,0
i saw this movie for free by the way so i do n't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie,0
so there you have it,0
overall a really solid film,0
hmm hip hop music to a period western,0
it 's the idea of who and what they are outside the personal relationship,0
the battling of the sea creature named nadia is also a cool plus,0
maybe he 's not doped up,0
there are characters that appear briefly to move the story along with no explanation of who they are,0
a goofy giddy adult satire that plays like a kiddie comedy,0
and what website was he broadcasting to,0
yeah let 's leave the jersey devil thing intact because their clever idea failed it just does n't fix with the rest of the film,0
michelle pfieffer the perfect choice for catwoman and was perfectly cast into place,0
is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents,0
i'm also really enjoying andrew mccarthy 's character joe,0
recently i sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing and i noticed this time around its striking similarities to the wizard of oz,0
i did n't think the comment was necessary and actually slightly lowered my opinion of the movie,0
it was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical much less to be dubbed by other singers,0
i really liked this film for what it is,0
the animation is still mindblowing i just ca n't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it,0
looking at this guy talking and 'acting' makes you wonder if there was a director who actually filmed him,0
i can see why this film enhanced its director 's growing stature as a topflight director,0
the ending actually managed to satisfy me a feat rarely achieved by that genre of movies,0
mel gibson took full advantage of an opportunity to bring this culture in the spotlight,0
fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money,0

maybe it was the directing,0
perhaps it 's what all soldiers dream of before the go to war,0
as film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god,0
but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned,0
i am not sure if his character was meant to be so intentionally funny but i found it hard not to laugh each time he had screen time,0
simply they did have a soul,0
perhaps viewers rather not have their entertainment reflect reality so closely,0
realization hits him and he leaps off the seat,0
if this was made by college students then at least they gave it the old aussie try,0
this guy is one of the more underrated performers around and he should get more work outside of being a terrorist,0
my friends and i found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie,0
however again i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value,0
have a very critical eye being a director and writer myself i say this film is a success,0
she 's been writing songs for a few years now the royalties have helped with her tuition,0
it 's interesting how the train of research can flow,0
that being said it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone,0
another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie,0
there is a little action at the end but it is not as good as the promising beginning,0

i'm ex australian army and very patriotic towards this great country but i feel this movie no way does justice for us and those soldier who fought at this battle,0
clocking in at 91 minutes even that it is written on the cover that it 's 88 minutes a mistake,0
the female warriors formula is brought to the future where they do n't have to fight warriors or gods but dangerous robots which dwell in the surface and the humans are forced to live underground,0
as the name suggests they wage war on everything,0
as a kid i loved most of don bluth 's work they were original and had plenty of dark elements to them,0
what 's with the animated birds during the cocaine scene,0
even some of the widely acclaimed directors in the genre like dario argento or sergio martino never managed to include this much genuine tension in their masterpieces,0

far from being the laughable joke that many softporn flicks are animal instincts exhibits dramatic irony conflict suspense and even clever wit but it still has some logical flaws,0
we 're thrown into the story with no background and feel exactly like the main character and it 's almost impossible to lose interest in a smart plot that only loses its edge towards the end,0
still he mugs well and carries things along,0
years ago i did n't love and respect the films of jimmy cagney nearly as much as i do now,0
yet it 's not an excellent movie,0
that was almost as bad as snakes on a plane,0
quite a scary flick i was first exposed to this little horror about 15 years ago by my pop,0
but this movie is not selfcontained like say the matrix was this is not a plotdriven hypothetical,0
the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional,0
i just wished they were in more sequences and could have added some more tension and horror to the movie,0
the first movie basket case was still a horror movie while basket case 2 was more like a horror comedy,0
i read on one of the other reviews that it makes you wonder if you have what it takes to be america 's next top model,0
because that is what it is all about what drives the characters and therefore the entire story,0
it would seem to lose some the suspense to it if you could just simply go into any corporate owned blockbuster type of video store and rent it anytime you wanted to see it,0
i think it 's a cheap way to freak people out without spending anything for special effects,0
good acting too and a decent plot line,0
i thought sparks would fly between him and alex but hey no such luck,0
the film makes me want to visit argentina and see in person their beautiful dancing,0
some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it,0
this is part of a series of films unrelated to each other,0
the movie is really in my head right now saw it this morning,0
i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time,0
okay so it 's not shakespeare,0
pardon me if this was a comedy then i did n't understand it,0
the wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases,0
if it goes on dvd me and my friend will be buying the day it comes out,0
show some effort in your work,0
do yourself a favor avoid this stinker,0
a group of normal college kids from chicago all unanimously agreed that this film was complete trash,0
jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable,0
and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale,0
the dude gets banged up but he and the mrs both live,0
it was much better than the parody of return of the king,0
upper middle class and rich class living meters away from the poor class my example is you see an enormous building and you look to the other side of the street and there are thousands of poor houses and of course they do n't mix but they are all breathing the same air and the story is based in what would happen if a girl from the upper class had a boyfriend from the lower class and of course they would n't have a problem but everyone surrounding them including family and friends would and what happen in the movie would be really happen so what i like about it is that it could be me my sister my friend anyone because its really amazing that we live in the exact same zone with the exact same places but to difference any other place in the world where it happens including cities like new york madrid london or anywhere else we do n't mix and this is the least fiction story that involves my life my friends and my family,0
there is a fair balance between the two,0
charles grodin is good but the buck stops there,0
we did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was,0
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games' a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game,0
chaplin 's idea of finding work is to usurp the effort of a fellow reporter who snaps pictures of the aftermath of an auto accident,0
they 're overrated and tedious beyond belief,0
but they just do n't stop there they continue to show this throughout the rest of the movie,0
how can you improve on this,0
all in all i am sooo glad that i found this movie and i will always love it,0
in the morning drew treats her as he has so many others only to realize too late that his feelings for her are different,0
the climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history,0
you have better things to do with your time,0
the twoway mirror is n't just some sort of tangible metaphor or anything of the sort,0
8 years after shooting her sexually abusive step father amanda is released from the psychiatric ward with the help of her doctor who she is secretly having an affair with,0
plus he is a very good actor who does what he pleases and likes to and never disappoints,0
it is so dull that it sent me to the concession stand once and to the bathroom once,0
this is an excellent film full of complexity themes and great dialogue,0
i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives,0
here 's a news flash for you mac you are a war criminal,0
this film is entertaining with slight comedy at times with dark scenes,0
more than anything the readers were phenomenal,0
doug is a very poor cartoon and the characters dull stupid and idiotic,0
the obvious reference to the blue fairy in the form of a fallen star with blue positive energy was just another give away reference to the classic disney take,0
and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do,0
salman khan always an excuse to take off his shirt,0
in this film the doctor 's blood is contaminated with dracula 's giving him his jekyll and hyde curse,0
writing a movie review for children requires a different approach than if writing for a movie club,0
i like a story where the good guy wins albeit the good guys in this case are aliens,0
having no name actors i assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you would n't know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great,0
all i can say is avoid,0
so in that sense i guess it kind of is a comedy all i can say is though avoid this movie for your own sake,0
i was looking forward to dante 's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime but this was easily the worst of the bunch,0
the ending i remember was that the boy was hiding in the house completely naked frances austen found him quite easily and after she confronted him she slowly sank to her knees and went down on him off camera,0
the writer of this movie probably wrote this movie on a typewriter,0
walt has dreams of being a hollywood actor but does n't seem to be able to recognize the obstacle that awaits him,0
to be sure they had good vs evil boy meets girl and some stock characters such as the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman but the way the action played out was often different from film to film,0
at the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be,0
i 've enjoyed this horror movie all the way and the rule of it is never trust a shrink,0
this is a wonderful film,0
inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970 's feeling but is disjointed in the telling,0
bond awakes in a hospital travels to venice with his girl,0
but let me say that considering the novel nothing good could came out of this,0
i saw this movie today and wow,0
the kids in the new generation do n't get to see it and i think they should,0
always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences,0
while this will make the target audience happy it will teach them very little,0
the attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up midcentury hollywood 's view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey florid a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle,0
the first leader replies something to the effect that after what he has seen and done he does not want to live,0
i rate the films 10 6 1 it 's that bad,0
he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast,0
the moral of the story if it works do n't screw with it,0
it 's too much ado about nothing fortunately it 's not included in the top 250 ps,0
bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism i must admit this rushed sequel really is n't as awful as anticipated,0
the ending is fantastic it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere,0
a great sketch show that is very popular amongst young children,0
they assume that if the show is a hit then they can pay off the debts and everyone will be happy,0
acting diabolical plot _ diabolical dialogue diabolical lighting diabolical continuity you guessed it diabolical,0
not to mention we 're given nothing until the last say 12 hour of this unnecessarily long movie as to why this guy is suffering so much,0
give it a whirl if you find bad horror films hilarious,0
i first caught this movie when it aired on cw a few months ago,0
his direction is heavily stylized but appears nearly accidental,0
it has continued to be a problem in the age of mtv,0
there are some worthy things but on the whole this really is the worst movie i have ever seen and my only 86 year old musician grandmother would too and believe me we are all open to all kinds of films,0
by the way he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class,0
the show is amusing but i suspect in some ways other than intended,0
you want a movie about an irredeemable person that is worth seeing,0
tom berenger was a great teddy roosevelt,0
sometimes the buried memory is in the form of an embarrassing moment like taking out one 's junk and swinging it around at a wedding reception,0
the film begins focused on the intrigue focused more on lau kar leung 's character and it ends that way too,0
screw you guys i'm going home,0
it should be noted that the two hardly talk to each other throughout the entire film which makes the last third of the film illogical and stupid,0
also the death scenes were horrible,0
unlike variety magazine who said ritter simply lacks sufficient menace and charisma i find ritter to be quite right for the role,0
and it manages to be incredibly ambitious and irritating,0
besides being a legendary adult film actor holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various hollywood junkies,0
of course he sees the zombies on the island and noone believes him initially because he 's just a servant,0
it 's far too weak,0
it is also somehow irritating that there is no character development and that the movie descends into a soap opera modus without being convincingly ironic,0
in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you 're never sure what penn is about,0
to say that sean young 's performance as a socalled district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement,0
sample scene the monster is walking down a hall,0
1 wow i was not aware that apparently owls eat such animals as cats and pigs,0
the producers were never on set because they just could n't watch,0
it gets a 3 from me because despite all its flaws my 3 year old loves it therefore giving daddy a much needed rest from time to time,0
barney martin best known as jerry 's dad on seinfeld plays liza 's dad,0
there was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with,0
by the time it was over i was cool as a fool in the pool,0
review of an american tale i did n't like the first and original film based on the same characters,0
there is nothing positive i can say about this movie,0
if hostel and wolf creek were movies about viet nam wolf creek would be platoon and hostel would be rambo first blood part two,0
why have i given this film a 4,0
they show way too much of the plot in the trailer so do n't watch the trailer before watching the movie,0
the plot is great for an action movie its the early 1980s and pows are still being held in viet nam,0
i would n't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it,0
olympia dukakis is amazing as a wife who has been creatively and emotionally stifled by her husband and monotonous existence,0
in the finals brock defeated rvd to become the 2002 king of the ring the match was good i guess but way too short so that was extremely disappointing,0
just go along for the ride and enjoy the entertainment and entertaining it is,0
the interaction of jesus and satan provides some hilarious scenes even the monologues of jesus were great this was by far the best jesus i 've even seen,0
the mission goes wrong and the remaining team flees into a hiding on the seaside,0
turn left was made better than this movie and those guys did n't even have any money,0
the family of the finzicontinis are rich and jewish and live in a huge manor behind locked gates and they love to have friends over for picnics and tennis,0
forbidden lie powered on though never losing my interest,0
overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast,0
it had to be the cheapest ending,0
i too would like to own this on video or dvd,0
there is n't just enough stuff in there to sustain a career,0
however i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium this is due to the palpable suspense and as michael said the believability of the characters but also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory,0
well what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty brutal villain,0
not so much the scares as the shocks are what draws me to this film and every minute is worth while,0
the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk their way of life,0
it 's a really fast lizard,0
this entry into the series has to be the best out of 15 it is absolutely stunning and actionpacked,0
i used to dislike horror movies considered them stupid,0
she covers her mouth and collapses only to be fine and eating food the next day,0
the movie was assuredly cheaply made and was only held up by the comedy relief of mantan moreland,0
it moves very slow and the screenplay is horrible,0
the comebacks barely qualifies as a parody,0
a bug 's life has that same charm it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects because even though they talk they still act just like real bugs,0
oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and there 's a lot of needless blood and violence,0
if only they 'd concentrated on her family and forgotten about the love story it would have been a much better movie,0
it has its flaws but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters,0
catch this one to laugh at if it comes on a premium movie channel or network saturday afternoon tv but do not waist money on this thing,0
i guess that would be funny in two of the three instances,0
we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna,0
i have just seen today you die,0
while raj tries to fulfill her wish nina is the one who has taken to the wayward ways of the west,0
it may not have as much conviction but this is wildly entertaining,0
secondly as a comedy it 's made the cardinal sin of being silly rather than funny,0
children of wax also shown as killing grounds is an interesting mixture of genres,0
clone wars also labeled as an expanded universe otherwise proves the other way round,0
the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film,0
but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven,0
the actors playing the parts here just do n't fit the bill,0
i suspect the script was made up on the fly,0
wow never thought i 'd review a talk show but jay leno is n't that great guys,0
what if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant,0
rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world,0
or contact me i 'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price,0
if anything i found his latest offering to be a lot less angry than most of his previous work and more thoughtful,0
jack frost gets 4 out of 10 it at least made me laugh from it 's awfulness,0
patrick swayze plays jack charles who is a hood always on the lookout for the one big score that is going to put him on easy street,0
shakespeare can be done intelligently and the plays were performed to mass audiences they were accessible and this version helps put a wedge between shakespeare and the general population at large and i do not think that the bard would be happy with that,0
i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies but this movie is bad,0
suddenly jones is in the attic and in the narration he tells us at that point that he was definitely not going to give up,0
canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes,0
when will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction,0
the ending is restrained as well making it unexpectedly powerful and haunting,0
why should we care about these people and what they fight for,0
i laughed much more than i did the first time i became more involved with the characters i began to understand the at times absurd turns the story takes,0
partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough,0
that said this is very good movie,0
if you 're a gilbert sullivan purist these changes may bother you but i think they 're fine and i love the costumes,0
i loved the first dragonheart,0
it 's bad enough our star blindly follows order and kills everyone who was n't killed by the six monster fish but after he kills the fish the government blows them up,0
she is played by blanche baker who i hated in this film,0
tom and his brother mike are deeply loved by their mother though the two are as different as night and day,0
watch mick as he get his rocks off during all down the line as he pushes charlie to kick it out even harder,0
the downside is that you might not get it because as i said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid side,0
of the seven primary characters in gillian only three really matter david a man who after two years still is n't over the death of his wife gillian rachel his daughter whose relationship with her father is n't too estranged and esther david 's sisterinlaw who 's determined to remove rachel from david 's care for fear it is unhealthy for the girl,0
the last scene was probably one i will never forget and that is n't a good thing,0
what you think you are getting at the beginning is not with what you will leave,0
i'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent i do n't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence,0
ill get sources if needed,0
unfortunately it 's very difficult to find,0
you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion,0
to give a little credit to the actors including astin there 's not much you can do with writing as terrible as this,0
his competitor is a russian chess champion who unlike lawrence harvey 's character is wellregarded and loved instead,0
since everything happens for a reason in life i believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he was meant to stay there for over the year that he did,0
gradually the conversation turns to the long dead friends or relatives the memory of whom never faded away,0
hbk said the last thing he wanted to do was cause any trouble,0
another reason why this show is becoming a failure could be that the writing on the show scrubs is excellent and this show has to follow it up leaving the viewer in an odd position not knowing whether to cry or to just lose hope in new sitcoms all together,0
there are n't very many sequels i 've seen but enjoyed,0
rondo hatton 's final film has him once more playing a character called the creeper,0
i wanted honesty with everyone and i found none of it,0
manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package,0
thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled along with butch hartman 's darling danny phantom,0
it is one of the funniest movies ever,0
i am surprised this movie did not win best movie of all time or at least an nobel peace prize,0
this however is a sad excuse for a film,0
i still do n't know worse i do n't care,0
i also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctly,0
fans of ed wood jr will appreciate the inventive techniques director george barry utilizes like stock footage and cheesy voice overs,0
going in to the sneak preview knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer i 'd seen i thought it was going to be a dude where 's my car kind of crap fest,0

when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about i felt very curious,0
it 's a true movie experience which i will never forget,0
the title the love machine is of course meant ironically,0
a tough movie needs to have violence sex and lots of situations where the bad guy is a good guy,0
watch the scene where om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father next both are sharing wine together,0
it 's sad when a state 's laws or a person 's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like,0
i'm offended that carlos mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily,0
personally i would give this film two thumbs up,0
displaying a knockout figure and wide bedroom eyes she 's obviously game for the comedy as well as the sexual undercurrent,0
seemingly about as crazy as young gerda she goes to visit her estranged photographer boyfriend mario,0
as i said before i was very surprised by this movie,0
at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong arming the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move,0

calling him uncle martin tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth,0
it 's late it 's extremely humid every breath is like a drink of city soaked in smog water,0
the screenplay moves along as if 10 different people wrote it and none of them were communicating with each other,0
it 's even reassuring in a way to realize there are strong echoes of the most dangerous game,0
terry farrell is an excellent actress,0
the miniseries of 10 halfhour episodes is available on three vhs tapes,0
you really do n't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film,0
i am suspicious of the criticisms,0
they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity,0
they did not behave in any way that seemed to fit who they allegedly were,0
the whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous andor ridiculous scene after another,0
2the spaniards arrived 500 years later,0
it begins with some young people at a party,0
don knotts is my favorite actor of all time,0
i also had wished we had more time to explore fujimoto 's backstory as well as the relationship between sosuke and his father,0
a provocative and thoughtful profile of the man both behind the camera lens and in front of it,0
and jodie 's face at the ending speaks volumes,0
just watched this the second of boris karloff 's collaborations with producer val lewton on youtube,0
this film was a programmer slotted in as a second or even third feature on a single bill,0
some scenes are a little graphic but they are not gratuitous,0
the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it,0
in the end there is something very important to be said on this issue it simply is n't presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious indulgent piece,0
there 's enough of old action movies with good action,0
she convincingly fakes an american accent and hearst 's pain confusion and terror come through,0
i have better things to do with my time,0
when i saw that the scifi channel was going to air a miniseries based on the earthsea books i was instantly enthused about it,0

i 've never been to vermont personally but i'm certain you wo n't find any palm trees there,0
she 's just a cosmic girl,0
this movie was really awful,0
nothing about this flaming pile of dung was good,0
there are a few creepy moments though and at times the music works well but overall the film isnt that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director,0
this outbreak was not cause by a virus or at least confirmed that it was virus or a zombie outbreak or even a gas it was simply caused by underground sewer rats,0
it has some really sweet and touching moments since it is the introduction of the lovable fresh pokemon celebi,0
for an independent film this movie has a great cast,0
and shelley winters will rise again from the dead to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie,0

hume cronyn an actor that worked with hitchcock in a few movies is good as sparks,0
a dance movie with no dancing,0
the supporting cast is brilliant,0
if you want to see something really shocking upsetting and disturbing just rent the original,0

all in all a really good watch a really strong cast great script great film,0
a great movie to miss,0
i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win,0
chuck later shares her plight with billy blaze,0
watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through kramer 's appalling script and hamfisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death i felt angered helpless and sickened all at the same time,0
where the movie does not wallow in clichs however is in some of the characterizations,0
the storyline is decent but the movie makes it extremely boring,0
your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book,0
i enjoyed lemony snicket 's a series of unfortunate events and this film 's overthetop storytelling reminded me of what i thought was lacking in that other film,0
if so it 's hardly noticed,0
teenage girls are being murdered and disappearing,0
and why do people compare willy wonka to this movie just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy wonka song doesnt make this film anything like willy wonka,0
i do n't know what the editor was on when he did this film but i want some,0
patient viewers will be rewarded with an acceptably entertaining albeit predictable and derivative climax but it 's too late to safe the movie,0
i 'd do both i laugh and then i cry,0
the filth and the fury a much more believable film about the band from julien temple who made this film is told from the point of view of the band members who contradict mclaren 's claims,0
i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong,0
nonetheless it works very well credit must be given to the costume designer 's and director 's of the film,0
the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place,0
i 'd skip this one,0
we never even get a handle on the characters any resemblance between the way these people talk and behave and the way real people talk and behave is strictly coincidental,0
sadly i can find no reason to recommend this movie,0
why does the son get all bent about being treated as a child for 30 seconds,0
he stays there all night and runs into all the weirdos so he finds shelter and runs into the pigeon woman,0
eponine does die for marius thankfully,0

tom neal also knew the dahlia and became obsessed from la despair by john gilmore the january 1947 slaying of the young beautiful wouldbe actress elizabeth short known as the black dahlia was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime,0
but overall an excellent movie,0
the vietnamese actors were thai,0
right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he let 's his spirit go into the scarecrow,0
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character,0
the thought that a place exists where rich people pay money to torture and kill other people is interesting,0
alda 's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies,0
this show is brilliantly hilarious,0
maybe you meet 'em in a bar or a disco you may visit,0
you wonder if it was all explained in the first movie but after seeing this one you know you 'll never bother,0
ultimately she dies either physically or through a complete and permanent detachment from reality as indicated by the brief uniting of her happy family son included,0
even though this kid runs away to hollywood it does n't give kids the idea that they can,0
the performances of the main actors are superb,0
it 's always interesting to see a movie from a play,0
if this were made at 20th century fox tyrone power would have been cast as the lead,0
the first hands him a machine gun and suggests that he kill himself to spare him the agony of being viciously ripped apart,0
while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it,0
the rest of the movie is indeed intriguing but has a few weaknesses which makes it feel a little halfbaked,0
a great addition to anyone 's collection,0
he is the only filmmaker who 's films had such a quality,0
bill popping out of the dirt and just getting it on with sookie with no reason what 's so ever,0
the sign language used by the little girl in this movie is german sign language,0
not likely he 's taller and larger i'm guessing in an attempt for a final twist they just decided to make him the killer,0
the movie was very bad it poked fun at religion several sexual oriented and suggestive scenes,0
my father was german and raised by a father who supported hitler,0
however i found this movie quiet boring and full of clichs a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc,0
but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike if the movie wins the oscar for best costume best director or best picture,0
it was very authentic in how they displayed the components dealing with this movie which includes the guns horses and clothing,0
no one seems really excited to be in this movie,0
this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original,0
secondly and chillingly there is the early meteor strike hitting some asian country,0
i mean it 's definately horrifying but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be,0
obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie,0
lionel stander is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of norman towards the end is truly hateful yet we must admit very funny,0
i did n't even think that was possible,0
but i also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history,0
i am sure there is someone out there who has this dvd,0
but wait for the dvd on this film,0
by the looks of things on the anime network i actually thought that there would be an interesting story with this movie scratch that theory,0
of course we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the discs but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome,0
i am glad they are skeptical but it 's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not,0
the acting is very mediocre descending into camp as far as the girlfriend who tends to laugh for no reason as if she 's high on grass though she is very cute,0
it 's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count,0
there 's a killer in the woods and picks them off one by one and blah blah blah,0
played in the credits and was made for th film,0
the disturbing thing about this film is that its realism shows us not only how these people live but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all,0
good scenes fail to make an impact,0
the story is dull the action is lame and nothing about this movie is original,0
you have a bunch of psychics going hunting for the ghost of a vicious and very powerful warlock who has to reincarnate for getting his revenge,0
it is a series to watch with your children over and over again,0
this is quite possibly the worst professional production i have ever seen,0
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that mark jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better i 've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no,0
you suck you suck so very much director,0
all of them hit all the right notes and nero and milian 's interactions are a joy to behold,0
it 's like he sits in his little director 's chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene,0
during the entire movie i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust,0
but once again your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding magnetism,0
this movie has around 180 fwords and is almost three hours long,0
this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain oh shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable,0
unlike in that version here argento puts the opera house in a good use,0
the robot actually has a production credit,0
gender issues revolving around sexuality and the machismo are shown through don ru,0
this movie is a complete clunker and was quite frankly boring,0
about 12 minutes into the song in the scene where daryl hannah and jfk jr are first embracing there is a really pretty song playing what is that song,0
while some cynics may not enjoy this movie as much as i do if you find that you enjoy classic comedies then you should give this one a chance,0
this movie is a must for those who think that catholicism is too mystical,0
on one level in the present it 's a realistic low key look at how some typical working class characters deal with disappointment and loss while poignantly cherishing memories of the more glamorous past,0
come on it 's an '80s movie dude,0
some of the situations are so forced as to be embarrassing,0
the acting is n't too bad,0
i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tapdancing midget aliens and wellmannered dinosaurs on screen together,0
my biggest problem with the film is that the directorwriter has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who does n't know the story will view it,0
the acting was great across the board but the direction story script and casting were especially good,0
so what is his full name bloom bloom,0
unfortunately there is also some bad news the story is pretty awful,0
the writing acting directing soundtrack production design and cinematography are topnotch in the darjeeling limited,0
it 's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes stories are utterly boring in comparison,0
i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie,0
scores of movies portray the victims of nazi atrocities before and during the war but i do n't think any of them have delved into the psyche of the victim and predator as well as this this one has,0
i also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it 's clear crisp just filmed view,0
there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent,0
even if you are not fascinated by this film or the subject of it you ca n't but marvel at the copy released by image entertainment,0
i ca n't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being mistreated and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see schindler 's list i do n't want to be entertained by other peoples' pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be,0
and what a great subject he chooses,0
they knew each other from vietnam which deepens their relationship with each other in a platonic way,0
priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming i do n't buy the crap that her role required her to act overthetop,0
all of this has a common thread however,0
yes this flaw completely does the show in,0
why did the father come back again,0
there 's another reason to watch this,0
what should have been a good story with a capable cast was actually hard to watch for me,0
this is screwball comedy by the numbers,0
we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face,0
what many people do n't realize about film is that if there is a lot of back story a narrator is typically necessary to fill in the gaps and tie up loose ends to certain scenes,0
muldaur made a career out of playing unlikable women and yet i always admired her skill,0
morgan responded anything with glenda jackson,0
they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated film,0
some of the situations character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who 's complaining,0
plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least,0
my wife and me gave 810,0
during their escape attempt the outlaws inadvertently kill kilpatrick 's own wife and child,0
i must have seen this a dozen times over the years,0
i located a reference to the movie on the web,0
the mst3k version is their best episode but it 's certainly better than the movie itself,0
this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched,0
there are some striking scenes the dance sequence when press and julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red and the end is very striking,0
in jack frost part 1 the main character 's dna got mixed up with the antifreeze that was used to kill jack frost,0
one moment henry is throwing the suit tie clad young republican into the pool the next moment he 's bonding with him and hiring him a hooker when he learns he 's still a virgin,0
i have books i ii iii and when the girls come up from florida each year they want to see north south,0
the casting was very much clear that we want young hip tough chicks chiseled guys and the girls who have brains also have to be hot,0
i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story,0
first he is miscast as a former highschool star hockey player that every guy looked up to and every girl wanted to bed,0
thank god that the people who produced this bomb are not working for the taliban,0
slater has appeared in some real dogs in his career but this one takes top prize,0
but to compensate the missing special effects the landscape does the trick,0
the story is silly and some of the special effects look rough around the edges but who cares,0
is this a good way to leave an audience guessing,0
the settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss,0
movie 110 because you ca n't give any lower scores,0
the story line is thin not at all gripping the dialogs are just filler the music is just too bad to listen,0
they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do,0
now the problem is this the cylons set it up so that bulldog thinks he has escaped by himself,0
how similar is the movie in comparison to the real events we ca n't say for sure,0
there are no critics of deconstruction,0
i will not take anything away from the acting both denholm elliott and bernard lloyd gave wonderful performances,0
everybody from the troopers to joe harmony knows that taking tucsos to fort grant is asking to die,0
the scene that she felt the need to separate her stuff apart from her partner 's right before her partner 's nephew arrival certainly reflects how lesbians are practically nonexistent at that time,0
even his attempts to inject humor are forced and heavyhanded with the idiotic scenes of bones carrying the heads of his victims and having them carry on an interminably pointless conversation,0
as always bette davis plays the bitch with consummate skill,0
sure there 's the madness that sets in but what about the quiet cheers brought about from a film like that spelling bee championship flick spellbound,0
while perhaps a bit mawkish at times this can probably be blamed on the difficulties with early sound technology which tended to limit action movement,0
in the movie there was a sortof villain one who was so obviously there only for the sake of having a villain that we can only shake our heads,0
this is the type of film that although it is not heavily marketed will spread its magnificence through people,0
he gets to sink his teeth into the character of doctor knox,0
the former student keeps an eye on the teacher when she leaves the hospital and soon his family becomes involved as well,0
a gimmick can work if it is utilized to full effect,0
it seems that the only serious anime now a days are plagued by feminism,0
still the content of footprints will keep you contemplating long after the film has finished and its powerful impact will only increase,0
slowly but surely he assembles all the parts he needs to construct a man but when the crude disfigured human monster is eventually reanimated it has uncontrollably violent tendencies and smashes its way out the castle to go on a killing spree in the adjacent countryside,0
the story is weak and it does become very silly at times,0
he does after all perform admirably and manages to convey the anxiety any teenage boy in his position would feel,0
this movie lacks in heart and does n't deliver on a fascinating idea a film exploring the lives of american born indians,0
throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you 'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film,0
she keeps the laughs coming all the way through and steals every single scene with her bright eyes and southern drawl but you can tell that there is real emotion brimming just under the surface,0
the best part of the film is the pretty effective zombies who turn up towards the end,0
he clearly portrays a character of courage nobility and gentleness,0
the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice timelapse photography,0
i feel like going out and getting myself a fatal dose of clap,0
lyle 's jokes are the only ones in the film that might produce at least a slight snicker,0
i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie,0
the rest of the cast is also good,0
the idealist denied his due,0
sherri the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped,0
one thing that confused me was how this movie was overlooked because it 's such a terrific movie the only thing i could assume is that during this time batman forever was also being released and this was animated so just disregarded sadly,0
both had moments in their subsequent careers but these performances are high water marks and that stands for acting period,0
noah and emma are taking their spring break with their parents at a lovely isolated seattle beach cottage,0
by 1983 when jerry made this movie the last film he directed many people had written him off i think,0
first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy,0
tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice,0
i really did enjoy the dragons and so forth especially the ultimate confrontation,0
furthermore i found chris and leonora 's relationship somewhat unconvincing,0
they 're two grown men to whose home is their garage attached,0
all of the usual characters are n't as annoying as they used to be,0
the script design of having interlocking baby monitors in nextdoor apartments and working that into the danger of the young children is unique,0
and if you liked what you saw in the trailer i think you 'll like the film but do n't hold me to it,0
his livein girlfriend has the upper hand emotionally he explicitly asks her for love,0
all in all although there are some touching scenes the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy,0
of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore a gratuitous rape scene and loads of nudity,0
that ending alone could have sank the film completely but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either,0
i suspect this explosion was taken from another movie,0
the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow,0
german soldiers were not the same as nazis just as muslims are not the same as al qaeda,0
what else other than cool camera work makes hitokiri stand out,0
i never got bored watching this,0
there were little things i liked about the film,0
the movie looks amazing the costumes emily blunt wears are visually stunning and the music only adds to the film never detracts from it,0
i feel there is no other actor out there right now that can perform such a flawless role as actor joseph gordonlevitt,0
why did people like halloween,0
one thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot,0
well i 'd have to say that i do own this film and i only like the ending,0
i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar,0
they all seem to be trying but nothing works and it remains strangely uninvolving,0
it was pointless and too obvious,0
there are some wonderful acting performances throughout including an exuberant bill murray who just loses himself in the character of zissou a subdued anjelica huston whose subtle sly grins and deadpan delivery develop her character far more than anything else and a spirited willem dafoe who manages to make a german accent sound funnier than i ever imagined it could,0
maybe i need to be drinking a lot and i mean a lot of alcohol to find something amusing about it,0
it 's just so exhausting,0
you 'll thank me for it later,0
i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in 1999 does anyone have any information on this,0
if you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about loveydovey romance do n't waste your time and money,0
even an oscar worthy performance could n't salvage this one,0
despite some occasionally original touches like the virtual sets that provide the background for the victorian interiors featuring ada lovelace and her circle this film falls short and ultimately disappoints,0
to its credit the company is very well filmed and acted,0
it 's hard to tell when the final confusing scene arrives,0
the goodness of this short paved the way for the loveliness that followed it,0
i think they will enjoy it,0
he is also the star of the movie,0
also is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark,0
the film pulls no punches in unexpectedly killing off characters directly and as collateral damage and challenging our sympathy for them right through to the unsentimental end which is probably why there was never an american remake,0
warner brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed,0
then there is the soso fx which help make watching this movie a waste of 2 hours,0
and it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for jamie lynn spears to be able to move on to movies,0
soft core movie from full moon 's twilight division,0
i now have only two wishes in my life,0
that is probably the moral of this story,0
it seems to be unlucky for a movie about a evil child killing other people it might spoil people watching this people please do not watch cause after the day i watched this movie it gave me sad dreams about patty mccormack 's death i almost started to cry after i dreamed and it might upset you a very sad movie and spoiled movie,0
shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to,0
however this was way beyond annoying,0
the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep but i just find him loathsome,0
summary a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting,0
for their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that 's because there 's considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off snakes on a plane,0
when you look at their respective filmographies you know for sure that agents secrets wo n't be a troy or a along came polly,0
there are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers,0
where i live its definitely an overlooked gem simply because people never heard of it or wo n't give it a chance but i 'll state that it is not a friday the 13th rip off the two concepts do n't even go near each other but in my mind it is overall one of the more impressive slashers i 've seen in a while,0
stop reading if you do n't want to know the only funny thing about this flick,0
that is all i will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception,0
however i cannot give the same statement for the music in this movie,0
this film has great intentions but fails in areas too major to ignore acting and script,0
the film is set in a small town in new mexico,0
so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining,0
jeanette dancing was a pure delight,0
6 the blonde who 's not mean an upperclass teenager with way too many issues to even talk about them,0
troll 3 a town is attacked by a mass of evil radioactive tree roots and as people are killed off our heroes try to hide the nuclear waste and attempt to save the day,0
if ever you 've got an hour to kill before going out stick on this you 'll immediately feel yourself growing in confidence definitely recommend it,0
acting is good enough that you care about the characters,0
for people never play rpg game i'm sure you still get many fun from it,0
he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster he takes an instant attraction to,0
the avenger claims his next victim on a night the lodger has mysteriously stolen out of daisy 's parents' house making daisy 's mother more than suspicious her daughter is in danger,0
they were on the move all the time and it was a very difficult shoot,0
there are surreal touches but there is also humour and romance,0
michael j fox looked so young but then again i guess he was,0
so the movie starts with three friends waiting for their fourth friend matt to show up at their vacation spot,0
still it is utterly unique among war films in that it focuses exclusively on the civilian experience the loss of humanity ordinary people undergo during wartime,0
the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships,0
as with the erotica the promised werewolf vs vampire woman action was pathetically short and unsatisfying,0
i know it 's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do,0
as is typical for the scifi originals the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them,0
even the minor characters like the waiter in the cafe and the policeman in the street are perfect,0
regardless all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings horrible script horrible acting horrible direction,0
and give it a ten,0
i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix,0
confusion ensues there 's a romantic subplot between dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents,0
joline who is committed to their marriage starts her journey to find carl yet on the way discovers a lot about herself,0
74 out of 10 the viewers must be going crazy,0
the film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief,0
duffyboy you are a brave man,0
his super commando jokes outdated disco fewer all the crap in the movie made itself boring,0
i really liked the idea for this film of groups of people trying to survive in a dragon scorched world,0
proof if ever proof were needed that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age,0
and each time i view it i'm more impressed by the story and the acting,0
half of the movie was okay acting and the other half was great horror acting,0
apparently bukowski 's work is based in the la area and this has been translated to european locations but works quite well,0
this one is just bad,0
the action humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time,0
while it is a compelling and humorous documentary that does border on mockumentary in some parts it does seem to get a bit long towards the end,0
the voice actors are also a part for making the characters so compelling,0
although the first trial to make a horror movie it was really successful,0
slightly funny references to mtv pop culture,0
we rented the dvd and then he saved his own money to buy it,0
some creative murder scenes and a fun watch with a party crowd,0
this goes double for white people,0
casey is given a doll for her birthday by her widowed father 's friend but she 's not interested,0
the film employs early simple computer graphics,0
as i watched the survivors i could n't help but wonder what was going through the mind of director michael ritchie when he was presented with the script,0
this is a movie we desperately needed,0
how about omission of facts for entertainment,0
i do n't really know whether cabin fever is supposed to be a joke or a film but as far as i know it 's much closer to being a joke than anything else,0
and the extensive lair of underground catacombs under jason 's house,0
there is the loud mouth douche bag guy,0
since there is no relief in sight carriers sinks into predictability,0
at least that 's the way i saw it,0
i did not understand how the audience knew the words to all those songs i had never heard,0
that is never a good thing to say about a movie though,0
i would recommend it if you are into gore,0
finally in the last scene you also get to see norman naked running across the sand and looking frozen,0
he has a daughter who of course wants revenge too,0
i really should have the viewer meaning and you 'll probably be in multiple hands like peter favorite barbara stanwyck flick is astounding,1
some people are is possibly cut out,1
i saw the piece but i really wanted to believe this has a particular scene within some time at the end and i expected a niche disney,1
the opening scene while fingernails i would have imagined the trailer service taken on all sorts of over time beforehand when it did not matter not too serious as those sneakers this film,1
i thought older actors brought him up,1
after watching a different little greater row and they are ambushed to make the good,1
it 's also the same name to go that i had seen a massive exhibition will like the movie battle of it they got emotional along with demolition,1
after a fast pace and story of the movie mostly partly of the film again,1
the family plot is built on the way 's vampires this film can appreciate it,1
auteuil gives the rock'n'roll realism and to every whole being her heroes,1
guys ca n't act in awhile except he 's dreaming about millionaires,1
when in its time gave demands to last about,1
he ca n't pronounce any of circumstances was bitten next to no mind,1
despite all this movie is much controversy and movement closed eyes with the whole wittiness of cultures any behavior,1
then they seduce right the period have a play on the screen range of how later execs can find that of that together for all episodes of the great line video with good reason that not a harry,1
this film get to see any sort of wrong fun for wwi but seemed like how the kindness credits and apart from his favourite,1
the violence appears to be the trick where the sociology weapon victims suffered him out for it again,1
i really hate my wife thinking when it would be just some other of its main problems i 'd be neo and i 'd go to olsen 's face as her loyalist law pursue people not a mile renowned performing revelation,1
that is this caliber found unique data have fallen into using the gallows agent what goes,1
i ca n't believe that such a musical cues and starts,1
at all and see it,1
the story has no courage whatsoever to that be believed they did not feel it just is boring at least because we 've lived in the seat as the peddler was middle of us,1
he will see her husband for marilyn,1
i do n't care about that someone holding time but the santa said it 's better ian tyson 's inexperience that chicken an emotional publicity field and little dated plays spring to pique its short plot,1
ironically this interpretation is not wearing a high rating and more affectionate ineptitude but it 's something should have probably looked much more and yet unconvincing,1
he does something cool even serving me more than the dvd player thus i think were so i fell around you off so more specific,1
the title received labeling a level keep for commercial effect the comfort to your way,1
i can any big night and so pointless victorian film,1
unfortunately he was left from vicious,1
other comments on it because of this story very well,1
they could not be quite acceptable movies like it,1
we get back with the cables that pearl richards and give a corner that does n't like when coping with her husband of the sea,1
as they are slightly over 's on the big name uk alucard and to be very interesting to write a nap porn,1

they still have a star yet an old system of personality loser is lodged with my local man wrecking hammer high 's friend,1
giancarlo fisher 's put and cool either slightly quiet,1

this is always worth seeing britain but because or the indomitable room we see her knows of music,1
he has working a line where the director members michael curtiz honest jo mulroney he has in the island 's spinster gives this movie real well in all of your interest but still embraces their intensity in every way,1
other movie little richard banning the gore company including south africa to add your hats up i like no substance,1
i would wish wait and while the editing begins about anyone wo n't resist overture and can sit around a view and still phone and does a time talking by one out of your vacation with links the cast in the doom,1
it was brilliant mostly bad as the worst since the local creep but i suppose this is really a point of a glance for most important elements,1
when there have me think they 're a bad movie really point but the bestselling muppet really the reason stand the different unpleasant setpieces,1
they were touching happen in the house to face most of the twisted punk king from the leadership of the horrific lesbian drama of power romance and two thirds situations cover the technology hook it times seeing a beauty of catching the character any wrong reasons to come about or do n't understand him,1
also when dylan turner suffers largely bad,1
instead i think please let me say how both interesting key out of time,1
are in dolby dickens' sequels the moon offers a great recreation of garbage,1
isabelle huppert must be a real ugly do it,1
for the mercedes but quickly unwillingly and her previous computer unnoticed collage cheese effects the later ward to form all of your plot isnt this movie,1
even if you watch this one but i'm sure i might as children,1
there is it for the mind,1
he did n't like it whether he was not but most wooden girls wine hacking on some time to its unedited disc and it is difficult to believe study of a longer distraction to save the actors' speed that has che 's weekend before filming on them the closest one and i 'd have against germany and their own shoulder then watch loud,1
with the christians is also not the best of all time with written then to make the way of cgi,1

his motive was this the better taste,1
it was really a good job for them such a cheerful mess but sadly intended to the face,1
with this a read for a back seat for this i wo n't rent it not as it 's really tongueincheek,1

this movie and one does very few than you having to discuss logic,1
anyone can make offbeat creations counts and then the speakers as white son of kent and are jarring is just stupid,1
of course this film makes films and misunderstandings about most human expressions and interweaving venue characters,1
some people made you 'll see her funding,1
it 's sorta a good moviegoer and unfortunately is technically a point in classical characters it had been granted,1
i am afraid to say what was really have made proper 1,1
unfortunately they catered in anything suggesting that his lack of companionship,1
it is surely one of the most influential then its front as staggered neither and now the movie benefits by the huge aryan they pretty a stage sense,1
after watching this movie it 's about racism hand niven as beautiful but nobody that you enjoy in spades in the film christmas mentality there is established visual numbers then they were compulsory footage of zu incompetence from notalent adult ideas without any experience i think,1
hellraiser at me where i was though with poor cinematography cutting scene and there 's something,1
i first saw this anymore i referred to sit through over an attempt at life the power as occasional of the ruling lot and it is true tale,1
this movie last night of asoka who vanished the we think it gave,1
unlike me the storyline was important but it is raw not that much,1
when that show just than a large just for me all they did an axe is meant to receive the ass and some reason jonathan angel disposal beach realistically in england and it 's like hitchcock is adaptation has some of them or bob fosse a criticism to deliver better opportunities she can already do n't expect it into a pair of guys cheating relative on the how much brazilian sign in the ring subject 's,1
this movie is a delight until much of the slightest body with a mean the act a one,1
later 's vengeful supervisor is never pretty sure you will never miss it although you will do not believe who and was in a moment,1
for those moments ago it 's disgusting for such mysticism partnership 's car story activist patrick swayze joining the much personality action with a climactic attraction of fowler the part enterprise each corner for bob an hour of this film with it all but sure that a little bit too bored the second,1
there are many things may be kusturica 3 stars so due to the rest of the film without in order to warrant maybe we are searching for the two parts,1

davis as that who brosnan will probably be fantastic,1
there are twists moves displayed this movie,1
in my opinion such for the worst musical use of all time and how unbelievably not really,1
it was obvious as comedy and on george cukor was the gang be honored and excellent in his caddy comments mature,1
despite all the casting live i was not expecting to be underwhelmed from a tiny film as a all scifi movie time but to christmas unless it 's like a cellphone of skirts one,1

the script is very many other oscars a few elderly bits,1
the photography would unfold variously you can get this slightly over the top and you would buy the movie back to even,1
it 's the worst film that with the lot the location of the time is really really good but let me say,1

it 's long live to man entering the script with everything in being mind from,1
i saw you a second shot of the lover,1
the storyline which spoil two films it would have never never portrayed it 's all the disturbing outs this was pure writeoff,1

the relationship between westerns as a unveiling that a porn fan thoughtprovoking that nbc had nice people and would have contributed to the chemistry between this film which ended an early stage more than an abortion it 's predictable,1
so the cultures are pretty much,1
of course and you might forget it all and cruel enough background afterwards funny' tractor disappointment,1
she was as beloved who have worked all up to until gogo is not surprisingly in each viewing it 's more of the three shades far from batman to shampoo bette davis in 1980 for no wonder where they did n't know where they walk out right in a line and roll the user rubbing hands with notsosubtle jacques dutton,1
i can see the running time and control about the kind of ethos it is so funny,1
apart from this a selfcontained parody of leno like charles and the better thing really,1
this film was good fun it 's not a fraction of which he should best guys but you wo n't enjoy 's going played by bob who dies,1
i really want to get to and see this film however was lost indeed,1
most of the comics keep together a female repression machine,1
the best moment and a little john minute to show up to make the worst thing that is,1
despite the sledgehammer discuss appear she worked in almost every wildly perverted way the rumble or lack of fun,1
i do n't think i kid ever as juvenile for a disney movie,1
his first car provide the puffy next scene and frightening and the fact that her can be had to be careful,1

they 're all wealthy company who works to make some sentiment,1
the older family is an ad film looking but played by the first story and also moving most of it is one of these zhang generation,1
it 's shocking since it does a very mature view of,1
i could not take it out to describe chuckle it 's going beyond my only defense mask but the plot seem down i know the wave involved the infamous storytelling touches,1
anything of his frequently love the rainy erotic victims of the touch of producers,1
however this was ok that will relate the film 's separate control,1
it was a contemporary film about 70 or five groups to select when he did its pratfalls action etc,1
altogether only found out a little more,1
i do n't think i was dumber but i have n't found it with movie copies of teeth if not,1
it is pretty or so the best armand to make good filmmaking arthur and the first,1
hardly you will forget how this characterization can,1
i'm not one of the movie,1
overall you think more fun,1
i had to copy and appreciate chris hawn and the plotline and throwing lizards telling you going to see julie,1
and i visited john w stevens is slim and quite affecting as dramatic as mean dr cooper does not have the credit for all it could have been plaguing the audience,1
they were told that he had no protection down and nitpick material and had wearing a break the characters',1
that was boring and cute 2the and unoriginal,1
it 's this case a false character and plot twist direction of a teenaged issue is just as effective for the humans where she needs the door the kill 's leader of 2 common nasty of wood in the sing of the torah,1
there is way too long but runs out of the main witness and you should write it on television but the only cast ca n't find the same ending,1
i can honestly see another wooden riding between the egyptian squabbling david x,1
it is probably one of the best shows you 've n't see,1
one day bud our holmes the film came home,1
instead the great choice of use to the prior that passes in the put on him,1
mr owen iii subtle low selfesteem climb this series more life to be missed any really against each other,1
hey then kick as a rarity which does n't making us wonder but i just could n't find that made for tv film basically richard life and you know for larry taylor and back or it makes such a good job of comedy that if all of the art they 're not only having memories not called frosty down to rene young,1
enough they wanted this pack,1
charles for both vaguely amusing moment it 's funny at all,1
it 's been a example of bertram as has any part,1
cameron barkin becomes a sign device and kill working in an early,1
the biggest disappointment the film in the confines of clive barker spirit marion was executed,1
this is just another at times and pops out there,1
i can give a 10 out of 10 the seven and learn her worships has seen their songs whether della having enrolled from the street citizen i'm feeling cool for some gore but i was a fan of anime,1
when i guess 1 really when it were supposed to endure psychological issues but i also ask that most off all had ever been will,1
we should have some fatal clothes as director his character where i'm supposed to end it again never,1
at least to keep the definitive aviation which is a classic video hollywood 's company american stunts but to have doubts that it really does n't watch them and when you 'll never call it top of excrement and would not want to forget as after watching it,1
i had never told which they were cheering similarly nor part,1
similar and call it as a darn imaginable version the fact that there 's ever gotten and watch this was the least one mafia cycle in her role in itself,1
not some surreal the film in charge of,1
it was an impact for the way when it was planted with any plot which is not for not crash this crap over the movie off and you want to read the horror alone,1
the supporting casting on the window the movie hinges around elvis than jokes ever described in all are 13 years and i did n't clearly knew why playing it,1
i really had come thru the line,1
little too long as bo 's love european almodvar loading,1
in fact the monty engaging christine being hired by murder,1
a fairly flat i did not and certainly the conservative rider itself was shown on the conclusion 's there,1
noone knows that when i do last one of the body when the easy will seem unknown in our television,1
it does n't warn you about 5 's,1
nevertheless i loved the surf body and excitement since come on dvd strangers likes with channeling this,1
we just meet the presence of euro have been a huge devil,1
i was expected that i also have more energy with lightyears in order to relate our screen time,1
of course do the cream spartacus all on the velvet norms to the hospital of their 15 thousand times,1
i had a decision until you know how much of the same animatronic requirements from his patients,1
who played that the output of how many times considered greedy justifies the game and crew but keep successful,1
whatever was drama with psycho is uneven for that one would but have better attempt so many times,1
domestic theory was ok at least shows they have cartoons and just doing viewers useless,1
ok with adults and nbc and the full of giddiness it comes door out of battle to the foreign isles was a room job had access to but fail in mainstream company or that the cast that a sly to see how bad bob hoskins no syllable on energy with scenes as some aspects they 're busy to secure entity,1
there are moments as the scientist came to desperately irene playing the party spirit em up,1
with his strong introduction the audience what any duration would i ever claim whether it only seen a movie to watch if this is a movie but if you like city he 's simply too politically sure as should of the ongoing scenes,1
they get a few people to creates some people of the dying story not surprising,1
max in the civil war is a bore for who passes along the ones proper to consume over there but that you 'll or tell you why it 's content but now the film the most arty points it becomes incredible and all costs will fit the fact that it 's one of the most notably documentaries ever at such a hair in one that would stick my brains of this movie begin to see he often agents is playing his head to him,1
i think you 'll say that it was you so very much,1
otherwise i was pleasantly surprised by how much tilted i 've rarely laughed for that would n't go drunk about them on audio etc today rock shot with the people getting the movie more than complete with far better known but usually i do n't only ask,1
when i found the salman here good ok playing triangle has invisible curiosity,1
it is scary with many woman who disagrees work,1
whether these people who get into after jaws team had that story of interest these werewolves rather thaw playing games this movie feels like to director this intense dreck we can change this tripe,1
as well as the rest of the movie although i highly recommend out that would ronald o 'sullivan status in the heat of australian archetypes on the blank personalities as it is deeply we never see this movie credit a whole but on the video shop of limbo and i was saying why this is basically that a leading man on is halfway that with his sensitive lives life having since peter first work up with jillian is the surprising suicide is frowned from any favours guilty is anything she looked for themselves,1
with some other americans famous contributes anything here also she 's hardly an accomplishment it 's something she 's ours,1
like some possible reason compelled for wilbur was not quite funny but also a little slow taking a lottery son and several questions that continue to say a purpose with moving miles together the setup in many hilarious female characters were emotionally written and very touching,1
warren mitchell often the twisted cashing upon in the events should n't be forgiven that for a second edit rented it in all disney 's powered his values,1
they really pity oh when the brothers that i would appreciate 10 episodes another way there 's two categories,1
do n't n't be bad guys and the first 20 years heard that many books were and then issue or if you have laughter and their turn on the cash against the forms such occasionally unpleasant blood she 's difficult to show they who sought to much from,1
i really enjoyed seeing and it was good,1
it is actually considered so to shake a man a great film and that pushes him up people sandra again and i wo n't defend the philosophy film,1
it was an adaptation of the way,1
it is told by arnold the pain of the killers 's intestines and master ahole and want to say so taking him with zemeckis' young girl and jeffrey hasselhoff,1
then the ranch a werewolf movie delivered in my days,1
along the way they seemed to me,1
ultimately it comes through in video stores and wanting to see it in your point of such 1 sitting in fact were imitated like a united black hole,1
towards the movie is 100 years old,1
they generally have the most annoying standout young girls and finds this version,1
buster was fully affected a character more of the lack of foreboding and onedimensional and unforgettable and some of the time ago involved of any law went,1
i really liked i can not help there in getting approach,1
tashan is forced of the wind scene generally will be trying to force first 5 feet,1
it 's style crisis repression and acting and twists match somewhere,1
the fight sequences were steeped from power it got me from the lack of imagination the guy a similarly tragic extent for one of the main players,1
then the country james a stinking and white joke of the characters of this i grew up,1
the writer must begin to follow about so often,1
freeman was awful in my era,1
the old language how a scene is staggering and fun to know it to see these guys who are the french shawn brett jean the peter friend moll burman and the last moments do not make appearances to be found what about a purpose 's role,1
there are times about the metro and sympathize with logging on speech while not comparing some of from all that the one movie of it the mummy game,1
lucas were naive can find one gay man trying on its he and many times by the most powerful toilet features directors involved but i really ca n't tell that how ought to find in what did they even seemed to be it when frankie wo n't get married of the music,1
this film takes me started watching peter 2002 but she 's could have tried to go mine as the heck,1
it was shot 1 years later and get to 710 but the way list at the prospect of the dwarfs attempting that her boy instructs themselves have to anyone ever even lovelier,1
unfortunately a story that happens myself,1
i had n't seen what they 've bought elements for some quick who conte managed to melt,1
a bit too when she would cherish him to get some actors and sylvia bankhead dir until someone even abandoning the trumpet,1
never tells her to a family jewish cast and completely unfamiliar,1
still not a convenience store in the 1980s film has appeared perhaps there 's the discovery of the credits just when she wakes up,1
they never care go then that the scenes was very poorly so it is not a little slow use more than kathy elwes 's doing dead night and ca n't help playing me' but he delivers a makeover into this is a result,1
be interested in the mix of purpose expecting him routines and hollywood,1
it was about 1100 and to one time ago i finally think that she decides to rebuild a name investigator walking back,1
if you do this to say that this being all the bw life and eventually eaten her friends in a mocking less by blow things of the stretch of 2 and manage to be possibly star,1
i 've been so glad it comes on this was intended to the series you may not be more exciting than choosing hands out but is almost garbage on television,1
i have no real imagination with this much for other episodes,1
what it was like the effort of the year so,1
i'm not to throw out of it but for the night video cover machine after searching celluloid this lowbudget relationship just solely clothing,1
mary ann did it appear lester 's ring last about possible being morally intellectually last,1
i had heard and from expectations,1
this movie is also disappointing and refreshing to twice because you 've seen,1
thats like the effects a lot of scenes wherein my problem begin quality but only to kill mic to increase the makeup,1
what makes me laugh was n't the neophyte character and i was pretty impressed for the fact that it 's too cheesy stuff of the mighty europeans,1
if you have fun laughing but would be demanding,1
if you think that will be so bad in the absence of husband,1
things were all seemed tame,1
then does it all included myself than rewatch to say about most khan this nonsense on cassette in the last decade were a fruitless movie,1
it 's amusing and pretentious and there i admit that the opening sequence and our angle and tenderness for the central courtship limbs are terrible forgettable crap and nearly no one who is having better expectations to people in our life,1
honestly this guy recording set is an incredibly poor action drama sound on dvd the stage movement namely vlad,1
at least 70 percent ratio effects flow but i was disappointed,1
only got out of consistently high on its own anything like thinking directors can fade the way together if by that mistake off in us how neat symptoms do n't make him dislike range upon similar side with the final moment are angry out of sexy clumsy sound,1
they will do it with this documentary into usa history in and be it immediately seen at least about this piece as a little poetic for its way to that doctor,1
what a disney film can watch,1
despite this movie although anything correctly a bad tv movie and a story release this is not aiming for a tremendous story it is going to relax down quiet,1
of course that 's what you can on tv because i complained how his work of freedom also compliments me to all a way,1
that is excellent as it justify what the worse movie shows it is a boxing film experience with the antagonist or science theatre film,1
we should have a strong effect garbage would have been an american world through life it was something similar on standard,1
what has produced in all,1
it does not turn from,1
i saw howard turned out,1
no doubt is very much distinct the window,1
it 's kind of travelogue you just ca n't feel,1
as the depressing for propaganda mature murderous we 'll miss lena david spirit plates as scarface when you they can see what any serious enough to have time except for another chunk aspect the reaction throughout and the giving it grand watching the same corps to offering her brother politicians he is n't shown social commentary the kids 's unearthly way for this film but this show has become pretty fake out of lesbianism but it only thickens in the real movies,1
watching and read the novel to find myself,1
it is more sleazy are serious that had another grownup mummy movie was dismal delivery that the film is overlong but for the way you can but the credibility of how i had to read my man in these days amid the evidence that the music of mathematical insight to the critical,1
the cinematography came along from engaging dutch imitations fast with forged rock very unfunny audio scenes,1
instinct then borrow his horizons is some nonsense,1
it is quite dramatic and too sweet from night,1
whatever happens in me here that too much the stories were in the battle of an african guardian,1
i really feel tired it 's the kind of contrived project,1
there are no mobile western sequences,1
it 's bad western with the annual spoiled,1
the american lead acting was done with that crap beach then being poirot in that time,1
someone in twenty girls takes you through for these characters and i would recommend surfing,1
like as manos the jazz marine fans were worse however you see him,1
it 's welldone you love friendship goes thrown on her baby anderson 's crazy film that barely participates in a brief outtake to anyone full of relatives it can only be a great sequel,1
it is the movie in it,1
then one of the most unusual jumping to the cemetery they are sometimes normal events,1
i saw how big brown 's car names and it has somewhat lot in their footsteps but i did n't agree this is the direction is a very funny showdown,1
this movie could give the usual impact,1
thats that moment does is get funny,1
when being sporting there 's something in this decade who is 16 on a clever fate campaign carlitos is on the ice nerd preston and frequently subverted themselves as a delicious for the king as the clothes and everything which makes this film a 410,1
the little children here which can conjure through from a heap of all a serious btch not crazy on making faces when the rating it 's kind of the more or more typical pubs to best deal with austen par,1
the cinematography is riveting as whether chairman is that for a young duo but a filmmaker board,1
what happens nationwide north cinema boo then drops up with the director in key period,1
he also has so mean the old reason games she still knows if it to be so inconsistent and full of one wrong see this adaptation not a thriller before the crossword church and a single sound line key but people talking behind this,1
this is to see again what is a seed,1
i do n't remember the actual budget the timing was so enjoyable about carrey i have to a couple hours,1
this movie is when having course the four the zombies forces in and wanted one of the 80 's rockin' organisation there were a lot of real scenes that were awakened on the whole weeping rather careless the railroad who switches on tv,1
no interesting boring overproduced bewitched had something to me i laughed in,1
as an adaptation carey offers to life,1
remains just the late written they 'd keep your money bite,1
her being still with promised,1
definitely this show said amitabh gary the mother joan blondell who mary steele abound,1
the third disappointment ending in word better 2 actors,1
it 's supposedly mere embarrassing of hercules start to star instead bison this was one gets held by television,1
he would have a better than they get arrested just as the two boys chasing throughout dramas and foremost life with his store baked blues fiction coburn fish baldwin and makes something nicely much to you like the cast,1
but the film is the hysterical movement and the trailer is it already i intend to say that i could n't buy the cover which gives it mind and it just seems to continue their measure,1
i really like they fell to minimalistic,1
a nice part about undemanding disney movies films of this and beat meanders,1
to go back to when it was originally played that anyone was born on these cells,1
once they are pretty nasty,1
i found all the exception with time with a few occasions but this one is n't good and i would have figured after watching it to reverse the memory,1
the third of the funniest i wanted this film out for nothing,1
the film tries to turn away funny later in comparison,1
but it seems as far as the viewers are either,1
clearly a military bottle looked far from that nothing scared along the ground,1
this is one of my favourite original performances,1
i do n't give this movie idea of times i have encountered a cry table to have a chance of the shell man 's part of this movie i 've would have already heard like the initial way the followup seems to engage in his second there does n't recognize the plight of its what because cannot going although mindboggling rising in the end,1
i could n't really tolerate it but the songs are very boring or either the showbiz craze would have given the powers off deeply and this film has this mystery of st lo 's morose sign journey,1
i could have to watch even renting this movie,1
the real big low budget in republic horror while production values could 've been why helen donnelly will make a glimpse of busty politically funny robert in,1
of course i saw this bad time to see this one if you find that given charlie six i'm reading a mad relationship in his full entirety with his usual impressions,1

a look at the suspense with 12 and for anyone and from me movies who have a big last person to question how bad here they 've all had in the hour,1
this movie is so bad it seems someone else is my very harsh discussions that tugs and then,1
before and apparently with regular bits,1
i like a scene where someone is her streak characters crowded to do and it just was just as possible,1
this movie is never on tv film by grown up out to be a milestone for many years ago,1
i 'd have not set a physically eerie script,1
but that easily maintained to complain this b movie,1
some of vincent carrey i think that kill a film watch,1
it is not made me think wrong,1
nobody can unearth the book from best efforts to you or learn the genre of that children,1
all that this a farce and pushes it to me that one of the line seemed that it was bad,1
i can only have a bank phone easily performed for references to convention,1
not that for starters it should be you in the bullying boy to unify his laura azaria himself,1
he could improve a day to pile kara sisters,1
you 'd find in this case to their partner popping and charging into his mysterious moments they do n't move along,1
i 'd remember a good fighter pic of 1991 these special effects some good laugh all gags,1
the story noir and the plot was extremely,1

the audience of the movie show is the genius do not say,1
indeed a horror flick not,1
decent casting directors is cheaply made,1
in fact not what i felt i really do n't understand any redeeming approach,1
until this takes during several times in the whole movie,1
this is no one in his bed to go,1
what the film would you look during your seat in spades by jp life',1
the family is woodstock and power gets to be imprisoned as they should be heads about psychotic and specialist warlords has trouble moving their brain colored conquests to make the world of frankenstein film sales treatment in another man and then in the wrong place as a hidden for the local captors who can pin her singing as the two rules,1
there are problems that imagine musicals dealing with examine their dreams which please take its mind movies but it 's the in the ground made in that movie and disturbing foxy singer ruth and 1994 in the years,1
of course young boy feels along with hand trying for the colour over the same situation,1
clark boland blatantly easily compared throughout because of late 70 's or renamed the inadequacy of the funniest was in all the freedom,1
if you notice judd everett mcallister ruth household stage to active what they in the wings factory and returns throughout his young unfaithful lead lover 's history,1
he ca n't figure out,1
later that kill the worse people are truly brief philosophy the that events exceeded,1
this film is a try you want to the guilt and watch ralph swope,1
infinitely more noteworthy times rent a while supposed to be mentioned is unrealistic and falling there in conditions in a lurid speech and children must watch it,1
when i think johnny was dramatically a little slow in the reality what they were trying to get hollywood others but i guess that it is just as untalented,1
jaques o'toole plays devito hamilton who adeptly reentry was the worst thing that was about in your time,1
there is that guest and take on that made jokes to see as if i pointed you for some sympathy for crockett go the federation faster as admired and the most good martial arts movies especially lead and lives that actually considered great,1
as i finally have guessed you probably could n't balance some nicely,1
one of the numerous things,1
however he was also the effects of the main level or feature and you can take for an idiot the two hours and still extremely not a person who suddenly owned cinematic and it 's unintentional in between the hill equipment,1
done of ridley bunuel 's profession is said most respected concepts and directing or a few laughs and some redeeming team it still had highly recommend yourself and the movie be excellent in the 90s of sandy or not the main event from this film,1
lifetime commented they think had her property from giving us up a way,1
the other mini death is true with justice,1
the american movie based on mexicans and these no wonder why he truly he seems about pedophilia character and charlize kristofferson as john and the minion in its time,1
in my opinion is not in by him for the restoration in the plot,1
i wish it is aimed at british pictures and books i laughed at a lot in that radio comedies of the cinema that 'movie' is what whenever the other team of beverly baker is putting answers what will have praised to any orders where the neighbor 's tail that she is how so he quickly deserved any 15 or good measure for its soul,1
three days they are trying to express his rear twenty years and if he actually ended up he breaks,1
i think the order on this is resolution in your life for this movie,1
the direction are ridiculous at times in the end they run into a crime ultimately he gets your son in yugoslavia such without it all,1
i could n't really sit through i remembered mr cord,1
if you like so if it just does n't have good chemistry between asians,1
it was just as ridiculous as yourself than love,1
i like an extreme factor again should have kept me as much,1
this film is difficult to change souls on the 30th of gameplay and some white activities done its a strange fight and the appealed less,1
unintentionally hilarious stuff could be rewound in mexico than leaving aside from broad dead,1
having said grey overtones by the same role comes from the fall for deep players,1
you get you completely irritated me this half hour i got a negative,1
because i have seen nancy q for a possible comedic plot soon read the unemployed mirrors is an interesting crime parody story about a novel while this film is enjoyable because that was great as good intentions parents are people first get this cry to this film i was excited to see it to think leading us wheels,1
but if you can tell viewers to my eyes of 1996 thriller,1
not just and nearly i liked this classic,1
this movie is a bitter textbook story and fun,1
this is brilliantly distributed on unwatchable,1
i think anyone enjoy the apocalypse did something with real story made,1
i am glad to skip it but this is an easy film with the day know about unnecessary english crafted butts changes on a separate of this moviei lack up in some hot foreign costumes together not to sleep in pennies and will just feel about forbidden yet seagal or is open they floyd pliers from this case,1
it 's ok if you already watched it all viewing for the keys to boast too much in this film,1
by far the films from a much more strange inspired viewing of ben 's estate when a woman but make an insight back in 1983 scott wisely students,1
bad guys and predators brush this movie in some japanese movies,1
but the story is not perfect how the filmmaker has to make famous but wo n't take their back,1
always who nails a film i really feel this movie with indigo complexities for the common merits over the other,1
it was about the trees struggled of feet then made one hell reputation keep,1
though i 've never heard about these hilarious bits such as a tom cruise manner because of her element in 1939 dig to prove to him,1
what would put it up about kaufman,1
save this series its little exhilarating i honestly just rented this movie in the level of reproductive films to pretty possibly the slightest and this movie is dull and i have guessed it a drama of all of me and probably they crack home on there they could truly wanted that it sounded like in 1953 yamamoto is with this film scares 8 mark it was on top 100 but i have all stayed in my life based on the crow iii and yet found in this movie,1
if you enjoyed in this film also cut up by a relatively indie movie one of work which a film who has filming style you nonetheless hurt covering,1
if you ask the best episode,1
the most interesting line from sex to favor and my tv before twice half for her food guide rust in oz that they have nightmares of her decision such starts to propel good acting,1
the plot is is plain annoying and delightful,1
it 's true waste of money but watching him various islands ropes and ghosts,1
surely the visual overload scenes work so could work all the point to effect,1
she was cold do n't stop the time to my money so there was one movie i'm sure somewhere,1
glance this is british and powerful to see the film 's time though at a time,1
a total nonsense by simon behind be akira made,1
perhaps it 's all fine there is a cartoonish story knowing from other actors the real episodes than the muppet actors just happens in on the media the end of the movie,1
not that i think anyone neither find with the quantity of the movie research just 20 minutes with awe or loss like a classic diversion in or something wrong unless you want to explain,1
this movie is really the most gratuitous these scenes been ghastly the story shows chase fire up,1
i do n't mind 3 and sunday since this movie,1
if you do n't get a better family,1
the plot sucked and we have been cut a hold on respect as a suit was n't it seem real and it would have been different than the new to expect for the panic perhaps gets clear that being i truly you can buy this one into your mouth,1
everyone in germany may not be able to add to her secret of his way attack anime on the quality down,1
in fact that i appreciate radio at the end to everybody who had seen,1
there are three times has outdated timing and that were dubious,1
not much appeal to takeoff was funny,1
just do n't care about accuracy nauseam on too long after the viewer,1
the makers you would n't learn for matt 's all young man james grant 's meaningless stelvio vita cards also so extremely wonderful with a limited and respect,1
then and the fracas calls caught to and they use and food commits with for what they intend to be going to see anywhere else maybe only interested in what the movie would has,1
this movie is to have produced intellectual decision to go beyond somewhere,1
they seem to want to go down of it anymore but as will annoy him and i got this movie through by free recently,1
the actors are n't as moving also as the four change to munch,1
of course what herbie secretary without stealing their approval from every college truce hero,1
this movie was the absolute worst movie i 've ever seen,1
this movie was hit around the first one,1
it 's simply one of the famously men of their failures from the way of danish when dancing the shark teeth in 2001 it appears as strange and unbelievable,1
not that one it is just right but i feel my mind and they evoke atmosphere,1
i really liked many want their flaws to get involved by myself like i soon still find solace of unintentional history tension,1
this film also shows start of the town,1
they could qualify this movie after his friendship,1
all this if you enjoyed up watching this film,1
the film with a film with all the lds war routines of a 1970s david cronenberg,1
paris to find the documentary oh yeah and one who likes about a mindless style,1
that 's action scene to be the most eclectic,1
the director older film outdid when julie astaire hall he 's still alive,1
of course not a amusing film even though is so long,1
i really do n't get in austin firmer or even regina anthony hopkins to his heels in the 50,1
its purpose films did n't suggest the general,1
the police with quite stunning thing blondie messages rolled,1
few scenes on the verge of period start spouting depending on every screen time well done his character while selecting his mini novels classic angles and i recommend this movie several very interesting characters the story with such naked not in good and boring and funny talent of the people i swear this know real reason you will be given it knocked out,1
he would n't understand this movie is also laughable,1
you wo n't like her present,1
eventually his other people collect embellishment 's tough guys 's power there is question if or scruffy were basic and the fact that the hammer mob 's boys can outrun,1
some are entirely different funny performances almost very part of the us and all higher places in all one who once more to mall this bad job when suicide hes a heroine and while on the proceedings brigade,1
as the branch is anything in acting that might make a good chance,1
wait for forest and succeeds and profound scenes,1
the first film could have been hard at what except it could do next all without me but i have heard to anyone but it was n't that it just happened in it,1
for instance no matter lee,1
there are an outstanding plot japanese country transplant lights instead hassle de meyer better movies with its problematic example in a larger scene,1
it 's far from his score it 's sad to see,1
he just throws titles into a totally regal effort he is ridicules with the purple version of gulliver,1

i 've gone into the film,1
when we get some of the best work with money into the 1990,1
only character is hacked off those who is under the 50 electric jolt and the verbal was similarly under them,1
this movie only is a teen movie as the movie that everyone is part level it could take a star measure,1
another disappointment for the widespread girl managed to get a different way to anyone could not compare jobs,1

this movie is the story that appeal more,1
once again the two was easily put everybody out and the flat propel screen and you can make you forget certain and the production about you,1
it is n't the country,1
the filmmakers will become a great asset of noirish moments,1
that 's left never any sparkle,1

hey after myself it gets one two days,1
which in all this film is a horny after being left,1
the script does not find a retired site from a group of outsiders is consuming recent fun of it was never quite really made to turn up a teeny public compliment as a remake,1
as a snoozefest the story was horrible in this film so that someone was in on tcm in the uk,1

folks there 's the fab team fails with the bureau of the film make it a letter producer was really a dreamlike plot it is really distasteful,1
most of its spoiled and offers her lines and continues to,1
when i knew that i heard that because i am not surprised i'm not sure what or you do,1
of course any era and take many things,1
the worst actor any of the introduction but i give absolutely once grateful,1
this film was mostly cannibal,1
after all the general designs look dated,1
if you love new was the story of the refugees,1
i found like the story,1
how could n't get learned in structure,1
but this is that unsophisticated but trite fun especially on harold and reporting most role camera and do a lot of sky zell even make an hour of a hard to see interest in sibling but a one but many genuinely animated movies with christine glen would 've made money to only this,1
searching 's appeal that you will be ashamed to certainly be,1
it 's like king drivers is eventually cookie himself at all of this part felt cheated to email how refreshing and insane annoying characters you need they have played this nothing redeeming elements,1

the ending 's still be truthful selfloathing or wrong the film prior to a cold warhead before the biggest laughter,1
there are male characters captivating scenes and find out a serious time to watch,1
back with bled are omnipresent but yet even the media festival 's new bride and the flower is stolen by the top legendary following,1
this is for me that this one is not even worth my hands,1
considering how it would sit around the whole message and solidly filmed michael cimino john leguizamo house heather while so patel adds to the ghetto stereotypes due to sacrificing her care,1
if you love this show is a truly wrong action flick,1
but it 's actually thin one by behind in all the film but i just do n't see still yet he just look kidding,1
its as it 'll be missed by comedy any real reason is this film is really horrible and not also a painfully wellwritten story shot for me how he has form using plot for traditional watch the fire sitting in achieving hollywood regard life of the caribbean and its loose battles mystery films for the east guitar 's suburban hardboiled neighbor ricky into surround,1
its faults mother blame the shoots of being the script is done in what it story arises,1
her one character it is completely crap and realize that the camera climax is stiff and intelligent in the meaningless just does not fly in any background scenes or cry and maybe something we were but i'm not sure you then watch,1
2 not even his usual cbs,1
a truly thought if i can comment on and the ongoing narrative on nbc movie its message dum,1

existing only opted for detailing its basis for a truly reflection of the people who left those hopeful print the sunny will not come such beautiful it be based on another avantgarde event with the same that the leader of the draft were the main star being there,1
at least films are seriously unfunny,1
maybe he was partnered with her and an action work vidal with citizens lay was up to college ploys weak it 's almost a total waste of time waiting to do stuff as then that insane can be,1
now is being predator no comedic theory teller has made it to the film in any other film but only it is such as childish and uplifting is already made it to and this show in fact the fact that they can watch,1
this is not great if you can find it 6,1
until it 's interesting during the office of the county childhood desk la friend bond,1
i had immensely no affinity for this one,1
sadly i have never laughed at this because there 's more talent or money to be in after the lives of the rest of this film,1
brent this show is sad enough they were tougher to frame was repugnant to be a chance to warn i was you why did you have nothing more of as it 's,1
if you know is what the film was truly unfunny,1
if you be able to fill off it went on a deep script,1
love to tears from carrie garbo as things,1
it is a thing that 's actually nothing to make the limit,1
what would be all those lookalikes,1
what a member of the truly vicious photographer 's career transcends a cast that calls of dvd,1
it is strictly to take their chance to see this movie just roll editing,1
of course but it still interesting the basic cut on the spanish you will give me immediately in the seventies,1
while this case i found the screen for the film festivals or soon after this film 410,1
this film did not stop conflict nothing sensible,1
of course some i have gone for off the viewer has just been for a political shock,1
even in other horror church the movie portrays about charming lights someday natural,1
she looks like a worm to through and we actually fall sour off,1
it is that just famous acting a while gripping to see everything and i do n't know why people get to be on screen time until it 's i have n't seen them there,1
overlong that was a zombie beneath a good movie rating sitting there with night the whole unit while 's pushing body creepy problems though,1
they have to have rushing to see a alternate respect,1
i had watch twenty because see it 's attempts to make it fired in a very literal scene about cheating everywhere,1
what can not work of an out of film that deals with it as theater with their dance method and makes a mockery or a zombie movie,1
not one of the best off splitting there to different movies,1
this film is also hard to indulge with an eventual story,1
this film does n't have some complicated suffering really sounds right at least two best actors with a great ass that that the spectacular it 's like watching for being crafted british or then the age of sixteen episodes even some ways in which michael h let 's be a root canal squad prosecutor of the metropolitan twist to stay into touch with energetic romances,1
the movie 's house and it 's like the equal lesson,1
i really ca n't like that the stage but manages to let me should of people who say that i 'd admit that it might have wanted every strange but interesting vote of the violence,1
this film does n't help up making himself with jose jai mary with british invasion to become quite smart,1
there are exceptions on that eddie murphy development himself and there was a true flame whom cool is the company african,1
if you enjoy things having genuinely some for feeling alas his father is desperately pregnant in fight is made as adjusted,1
the more closest world portrayed on the house and the cinematography was actually forced off bergman rounds some and get acid,1
the first use of actual events going place when his character and i almost in the first half of the series in talk anyone can remind me pieces,1
men that sucked to create a central dream,1
quite frankly make the benefit of 1946,1
matt tate is arguably a dream on his best use it is so coldblooded,1
do n't watch much your comments,1
then you just could n't for the end however were never given something so turkey,1
his best kind of comment i loved 45 films this movie company handles it there were six different superheroes if you were gobsmacked for an hour to see everything to cash in in this one and still in the windows to deliver what only could make in holiday for you,1
is a film for all those twists while watching all blacks from the uk,1
a group of the games is a horrified of the games,1
then one to work as i was not sure i had some good expectations,1
we 're searching for the sctv you would be a lick better would really be starting to explain or just a scottish character 's own way nowadays is told off in good a pretty unknown fart resources,1
that would have been started with everyone,1
the film itself hit up a pretty many of its parts,1
i really would love a film buff to without cash going by awesome film and reasonably tame,1
there are people including with a circus with a major draw of main survivors,1
right i remember many of the kids choose scene in a crap on the next,1
one of note robert foxx could n't make this one 210 unlike all,1

whilst his mean spouses removes the performances by both short because of the crimson phones all director 's bits or so festival and maybe they are usually only so bad it is most famous sporting sub i 's just a fun deeply ridiculous sort of picture without an achievement session know too,1
the other holidays from the brain we 're used to enjoy it,1
hey there was plenty of impact on and where we see life of the dove facility,1
enough people wanting to video store,1
the end of film the these likely are doing,1
the jokes bore you funny,1
and i 'll see but i love the sex video and we were picking up i 've no longer,1
since this plan was all so dull the main new tragedies of their eyes and overall accentuated the hell of long,1

you 're living on pbs,1
i thought this would have been more fun,1
this movie would have been to be overweight basically finally have any wonder for production of tyra became in the absurdity of a porn film 's or amazing literature that it 's reported the first place,1
not this film will put a few nice,1
after this this film is not even the most part it has if you want to guess the viewer to make and demand for some hilarious parts gets lost all,1
the filmmakers read on my life and again for the king in field and make good children directed by reality though the movie and why does she would use a remote prison he needed just as the recipe,1
it is a true tv movie but you cannot get this garbage,1
the way definitely lowered on their careers appear and friendship for best is my husband i mean this because of seeing the better i have seen,1
i can go by leone and his brain that again going to serve tom to propose and their later in his future twilight zone but not going time a connection scenes upwards is what could you know about while that character with freakazoid is not trying to convey how about i said as joe life mixes giggling the phone springs ship their needle,1

also has angered hints for watching this movie it wo n't actually remember,1
i guess i was long or has a pretentious tone or we see mick,1
some of those of this film and not enough reason and 1940 fan but the swedish 30s of harold and in the house wooden is nice in a period,1
charlie was kind of their built as brando is going role they stop sending a character not,1
to me highly recommended out of your own relationship and might n't have been kicked with facial krabb,1
that is present exceedingly young by mexican group geraldine and will look in european person i am surprised that the action on this film based on the monotony of this background do n't hear this movie down to 1942 research all references to human relations with martial arts culture while the director in another has the only only good movie,1
as the first film could n't the film,1
just about a load of the film,1

i can left out and see the very best picture but the never over the first weeks after the overall perverse material of this film prom,1
what did i want to the first listening to the beast with noticing how ibm were ashamed on it,1
does you do n't even deserve such moments though it sure will be a fantasy of two scenes unless you 're looking for a better experience because,1
it is not sad to see the difference,1
next movie that will give the mouth for the mormon countryside are quite annoying to feel lots of touching actions into any final spinoff you know a bad reason,1
the show are satisfactory and then we find the new sell and even casey roberts character is the virus and every adolescent scenes that have a beast until clara back but no longer,1
of course finally has met the actor,1
oh yes it needs a degree of the action scene appearing in this,1
i found off spiders of unexplained while the cell that be help,1
there are good acting skills tunes and a lack of the visual skill,1
of course i'm not sure that a blue refuses to give me of the children,1
due to it was the fastpaced,1
the audience that imagine friends the films not any more but the original style with hairy visuals are both broad as the whole title trying to sell the game,1
the storyline as indie films i have left every break on to do a few softcore quality background is easy and filled with her and most concept makeup by the army so christian fed and that is fast and wondered why the richie is original mildly bad though focuses mainly by reiner as dane north carolina championship,1
the other comedies stay down by this,1
it 's jan carpenter was also funny ok particularly the child character,1
the sets are there the telephone dvd flows into it 's good thing it would be naked about achieving the line,1
of course and finish teachers destroyed the role of christopher lloyd steals the year,1
it was an animated series so for his family as none that he does n't think the work of series using it 's to deny that it 's wonderful in hollywood 's dialogue to the gut cimino,1
there are n't a tad away,1
this is a cameo trying to be considered almost at least one today,1
string but i know that she did n't mean after his relationship in burbank,1
it does n't have taken sound badly unreal,1
it was about a good idea,1
powell and we 've only familiar in all by all time in the movie but i bought and watch it on cable credit for the wonderful direction which contain the more than the purpose of sandler,1
he just manages really to suffer underneath and their way to help but hey i really lack their decision having such the racism message waned on literature a metaphor that every knife in a front,1
hey they use before the important footage with the chubby experience,1
i'm not offended the letters pointed from the studio date when the nation approaches never helpful to move from one of his time,1
neither the movie is by far the added audience embracing the hell of siblings and leave she said that its continuity,1
it was a exploration of incomplete,1
some of robin is never 100,1
the music score is a waste of time of any of any horror movies that every character that is for whatever ai n't either could n't see what he can stretch in years ago at a time on the game,1
i think otherwise come back out even more than a doubt that which of project came across such and all disappears i'm very entertaining clean again to tell him the stage loneliness from the top where farrah gets transfered home by rendering on the main where tightly issues,1
i really enjoyed the film fun watching this world and miller,1
nothing new and the humans rather well just by the same the game but amazingly remarkable but then giving it a 1 a complete bit of film fashion and it will ever be more disappointing than in screen time i live out from the film,1
see for many insidious moments purely in himself,1
i really think i ca n't high hopes there value some ideas are right best sound but oddly acted,1
then seems very well done,1
then it is fashionable i felt just to laugh at the opening credits to the end to pretty shy bflick and can only explain i agree with any curiosity and i saw about this,1
why do anyone 's uncertain others should imagine this film time,1
the plot transcends its important fluff and are soon shown to is very original,1
the great person somewhere would not regret that the movie needs across or is too hard to the truth,1
it is great because of which it won those,1
off we could love doing this bizarro,1
then when much in the union disc there is no doubt and that the filmmaker was happening than the photo owner at a time with a towel the plague guy and lots of weird music in another case of place,1
i saw the acting on condemning the disappointment to fairly having trying to say he lights into a chemical monster to the man who infiltrates betty baxter and the so while they get deliberate as mary or just zero little sequences it is her multiple fantastic classics,1
lot of stupid actors like waitresses,1
perhaps this little character was dating the way it had rather an heir see originating for what i can tell a detailed little tension,1
that is n't so painful to hear get distracted anywhere considering the point of the house was you actually put through films which easily suffer from my leg and the plot had herself until they intended to attack back for it when macauley appears to be a poorly filmed oscarworthy situation while completely a lot of running animals and will make great fun movie and was a local house if adam did n't think,1
for the form of nasty candles dexter the interpreter the mess of peckinpah shows who are not going to emerge and the old gets taken straight in that van spiral from once in terms of the sound of the movie,1
granted i was captivated from voyager i saw azumi when a kid for either what this movie was all,1
i 'd have internet cop casting with three hours after it had described,1
i really wanted to ever realize it 's that place because it 's beyond me,1
after seeing awful standards in itself early in the male erin mcadams does not threaten to crash woo the lure china it was a funny story but then hacked the personal problem at various funny moments from a kiddie detective 's bits,1
i found this mockery of a movie fan and got a night 'cause the scenario and several people who nodded into the hospital,1
i am just afraid was really dreamy and if this is a low budget for 70 's,1
then i had to see this far better acting,1
i love favorites do n't buy this is to see how stallone a bad thing and work fascinating as ten minutes the character i was a quirky movie,1
the script is just use of pacing,1
everyone 's acting is humor he uses some error from the large struggle and by 7 special angles who on a point,1
never has tried to cover with plenty of personality nightmares blah blah tv television the sudden setting had so many mystery was a theirs,1
however it continued never corner also funny,1
my friends to do an extreme iq has a waste of time,1
from a farm since not through this small village carefully and just died after course the climactic chord in their films of them just kill it or even these repeated threats,1
thereafter soured in it make it best to watch,1
of course at least showing a little boy else and start the mimi transplants seemed to laugh at moronic fright queen checkout acting is no 8 years ago,1
the acting result in this particular point actually made it a 7 year old spot shooting to chance to kill it,1
the action between patrick young friend a very prepared french days,1
other actors have a masterpiece of archbishop these days with drudgery,1
the show certainly skips across the middle east macdonald the contrast,1
others may anyone can watch this and so this is a movie interesting too every opportunity to cover improvement in work so it kept its mental history,1
i really recommend this movie 3 and i thought about those point in comparison,1
frankly they appreciate the very zone spielberg was a boring horror comedy unfortunately is,1
he could really be shot with his relationships surprisingly in this film rehashed of farce at the least by discourage you and make this genre,1
the most improved is a substitute within look is attributed to the possibilities,1
originally in any terrible form with the dalai lama,1
