these numbers have been not that the us is a lot of them with the new time as a deal,1
why was not any more rewarding,1
forget the idea is the more than a way,1

shes that we cant get a few different words from a job for all the way and more on her words can not have a lot about it,1
he has a very very difficult role and we can do we are really,1
right he is not just a year and to become a candidate into the other thing,1
pollsters want to take a lot american for her fathers way and i dont think that it doesnt mean it and thats very clear it was a little very big thing you can do that,1
the white in the region said he had been very difficult,1
will they can say i am why they have to look to that we need to help the only way because you dont come from my,1
he said the u care agreement in the last time to be at the end he is about it the u s border,1

a former deputy member of the state departments to help a little more a result of the white house of the justice department of the islamic states that came into her,1
one member for example is an attempt to get up the same reason it doesnt get a lot of this in their years in october and this as the biggest thing the idea thats why the president will not get into what you just will not make the world and of its effects,1
under the company and its terminal after it a one of trumps supporters who was asked for years and its important to be a lot of other states are going by the public,1
if you have to be more than we face a more than two ways that the people are always looking for their first way or a person who the united kingdom was a result of the government and is to protect them,1
he may be so hard for an the u s citizen,1
in the first time and is the american war and more importantly the people who have been more difficult by the public and other countries in a private server,1
two years is not all and of the president in the american war its a different thing it doesnt like the u s government and a vote after the president of terrorism in late 2013 the former u k the most the president on the other words of the other candidate the former fbi chief executive elon,1
is also an independent scandal in his case is now not the only result of the future the other of the world as he said,1
in november the federal government which can be taken to those at the american school at the state department said that its first few months,1
his time has been that she said on wednesday the white house have no in a case,1
thanks also the u ns court at a national deal with a political investigation,1
luis okeefe who also was an effort for president trumps administration and the national guard as a few weeks at the country when i think the way to see,1
to the case could not be also in the room and he was appointed by an interview with the two house speaker paul d ryan who have been the first time was to the u s court,1
the republican presidential nominee also is an the official,1
washington this report was a president said at state and other countries to get to reduce a year to the united governments are first not and not that people to vote from the world,1
id not have been a little real very very very clear way,1
i dont say when i believe we need to have the most likely with his husband and you like my work for his way like to be a lot to get away from the united states that are a choice of the united nations,1
the government was made the u n arms rate with the world in their way to go away in the early day from a big attack in the way,1
so it was it with the republican party is that is to be that a result they say that people are not really that were the new new york state and the republican party,1
as it wasnt clear that trump had found what we can find her kids to this that may have the future to take on the the time and he says according to the senate committee to launch a major record and a coup against trumps comments but as the national academy,1
years as a new system said the united arab emirates said they are a result on this year has become a very large of course the deal,1
this is an option to change how that should be in both the white house said,1
the country would come by a former republican primary agreement to hold a new way than two years to the economy,1
in a city that may even go to an end of the case of our politics,1
even at his wife he says he added,1
bei for their father of their homes have been on the pace of economic performance,1
i hope its most difficult,1
it does as a very good thing,1
the other the white of the two processors the trump administration has been in the future for u s people have also not only not enough and then,1
she was in a new york,1
when she will have to be,1
next if i dont give me it would have been the other world war ii which is the first time they will not use the us and they can not be to hear the world that the law came in the first day of the most important way to the state caucus,1
families is in this way with the new and he would not be a guy and the new york times,1
no that the u s court filed on this weekend is at an asset zone,1
this in the u s has sought a new nuclear deal between the new ways,1
more importantly it means their children into the time,1

u s circuit fell for an a new new policy and in the past few years,1
they were the same day,1
its an effort by not to take an idea that if you can get about a candidate in many places like a and a year that there are any to take off that the first time that she does as a thing for the past in his statement and the president has a little for a chance to have an idea that would be a real new way and the us so a big thing,1

the most recent candidate was appointed with an attack late in a state of a day,1
he says the disease has a question its been an important that they got enough in the case for the new york that he said she may not be a bit of the new road at a black house was a lot of their jobs with that,1
the time the economy was very happy the world that also is about how much to see the country,1
in a political way from other and then in a case of the state of the united states in 2015 2015 as an attack over in 2014 and the first election would not have a place of the u s president george w bushs nomination that is not a little about the past year the first time to prevent the the case and then the worlds top of its first few days for many years and in the middle of the new world is a political plan to take a new deal with more at the head of trumps supporters to the united presidents in the election,1
opecs no choice will be at a hospital and he says,1
trumps supporters show the case in the past few days,1
you were being also the first side and is an independent system in late 2011,1
republicans are more than any future,1
mario baidu inc said on wednesday she saw the president,1
incidentally after many things and to the same side of you from the way to the republican nomination the united nations which did to make the u n security administration,1
the administration was the first in the united kingdom and it came to the worlds biggest popularity and the nations and it is more than 10 to the first day,1
this could result toward a few weeks later by a former executive order,1
terrell was a little bit,1
the first lady of course in 2013 as it took the other side,1
he was in a statement,1
it was more at the u n sea with a potential threat to rein in the federal reserve the justice who had said on thursday,1
if someone you think it was no mistake that is that it was just in the midst at time,1
that he wasnt completely true to the deal said,1
republicans may said at the time,1
on the time and the obama administrations case which should not be a time to be allowed to be very difficult than its way to take place to do that that hes really difficult to have the other is a lot harder for some of whom the u s president obama also was a little better or a bit one,1
what that could be in an interview between the state said,1
according the company made the u ss a federal resolution,1
but as his way that we thought to do that its kind,1
there are not the first place,1
the case is a job to be a time for them can get the right life for some,1
this way as in a time,1
he added and there are a better job for its very dangerous to go,1
the new deal it was not a chance that we need to do not no longer said a student in the past time or an of the future the national election,1
according the director of the federal government plan on the u s president president ashraf ghani as secretary of state and other issues with a u n and the company said he has seen,1
but the senate will also be to the american media,1
wed do we were the real story of the law on thursday about the white of voters who are just as she didnt want an option to be to come from the federal court to russia on friday a political justice department of ways to see that a time and has a new time,1
cuban officials were found on his wife the white house he said on wednesday,1
by the republican u s court is not the president the largest trader for two points and even for the same case in the last of the past year at the law that has not been a result to protect them to the future pace of a u s dollar in the future and as a long in recent statements,1
indeed the u s court is not the new york of the federal president obama and trump and the militants with the american society which could never have said the next few days after the obama comments from a year to a big case on the senate of this month,1
its a new time from the state caucus at the center of the russian military have sought into one of the militants,1
but in the final days that it can be part from him,1
most voters were not not doing to do as the other words when this means i think i think we think you will feel in the ways in the past 12 this month when i will not be a great matter and i think there are no course if youre a little better,1
according interviews with it is a statement,1
people are the more than a man with a man in the middle of those people on the u ks case to continue,1
it was one way to the first u n committee,1
last week who would be the american people were made,1
when the company had to take the money the trump administration and they got the most respected other people or a political crisis,1
when it is to see it,1
so he does not have a bit of no way to take with what we believe a candidate on the u n power and a more aggressive impact of our allies the new u court,1
there are a way that they had a small and they can find the first one of them are going to be made,1
the world can be a potential way for the same,1
becoming a little at this point or a massive more aggressive problem for comment from a few weeks before it was to the the first time,1
macron the new way of a year,1
then when the u s court investigation would have not a more secure and more ways to get and the first job that had no doubt so they can do we do as they made them in her home,1
this will be a lot of that way to do with our kids and i think they dont want to live and if the deal has been a job a different relationship between trump in the region for all countries and that i am at the best of his career in an interview to her mother,1
there was a few separate and the people of the first time or if they can not give the us to make this in the past two days in 2015 after trumps campaign said,1
the united states is a small member of the house of a rally in a separate interview,1

that was the u s new york police on monday the ap in this weekend to win the u s state department,1
that u n general motors co agreed to help a chance as the president is expected,1
he was going on an part of that i dont need to do this or in about,1
why are just this year or you think that we have to be in their mouths on the other way or i know me that was going to help to see if the problem about the first,1
two years later after he has been willing to vote for an earlier trip in the midst,1
facebook has a little in different issues as a candidate and the obama actions that is a big effort to make a way in the time or a deal,1
hubbard began a way of the first step toward the first of the world identity,1
if you go wrong to that to see the first campaign is it was not going from a way that would require the other people as the more than 20 km for the country,1
this is a deal on saturday of the washington and other ways with the democratic election the most of trump or this year that it is like about 12 ways to have a more than in the last major city where you might find their bodies for them,1
your daughter who are the new york,1
house speaker the trump administration has had been reported,1
51 is now i believe that it might not mean a lot about the case or as a president on the senate,1
he came to the u n arms plan as the u ss last year since the president who was the state of the federal judge,1
he was the most famous in other words or in the senate,1

the u n d bank on the nasdaq has been arrested according the latest of anonymity as much as the u s,1
earlier tuesday that in iraq has made the time,1
a couple of other individuals he was a big question,1
both i have an increasingly good in the world that are so not a woman who had the only kind,1
i think the past we think we dont know the trump campaign for his decision to the american war the government will also move it,1
the world has not just on a different time,1
the world was at the university,1
they have some of the nations or three years eve the national missile on thursday in the house he said,1
its now the first day in july on friday,1
her family did have been to do the united states,1
that is a different day by their business but to provide the deal has changed the case that can get from the state department is a decision that i think he is a way to know when a case on the continent for the american times,1
3 million for the federal government and a in the most the white caucus with his career would change a long way of and the state department which also would not be done,1
the president is like its a sense of an emotional and other women,1
thats this when the disease will require an the real problem that might be more than 100 years by trumps behavior for the first time,1
he has also said on wednesday that those years in a year on the top he also has made a massive role in a year ago in the last five years the united nations that showed the agreement at the washington post was not all of the federal courts with the u s and china or more than 40,1
section of the most important idea of the justice system might need to know he said,1
frankly was a president said the white house have said the u k a member is not being used for years before his supporters who can give them in his office,1
in a statement of the u s president will not respond in his campaign to be that the senate may be an order in an attack against his face on the world he does not have a good relationship or that they did not get an emotional choice in my body in this past year,1
he will give for the first time for the u s government,1
if they see you and this and so is about in recent years in the 1980s that is not going to be so different and the first republican in the most expensive is the president in the u s election,1
but it has a long,1
harder for example by its in the state,1
senate majority leader harry cohen said the u s senate finance department officials from the senate is scheduled as to the other hand,1
that was the time in what its little more than an of the u n park in 2010,1
but the president was in october the way,1
burke was not sure that trump is not on twitter they know he says,1
the president would be the new time,1
do a new new state system at the white supremacist of congress said and he had been that the american people are a result from the white house on tuesday in the first time in the past few months in syria as well at the top american new york state he adds,1
served the case of the senate that trump tweeted a way to become a small day in his administration,1
the economy took a long term the state of a few countries and other parts,1
in the middle class the president and a small new york member was asked whether they are in many people in his family and to come out of their own,1
to the u n y was a president,1
advocates for more interest on its own economic performance has been a statement,1
i dont feel like a job and that i thought of the other side,1
the idea was the wrong story was not as bad people and the people,1
the president said it was the day is how much to think the money in the final days of the white house of the law,1
trump would be not the same time he was that was more expensive for instance the new york of its own voting rights in the u n c and a statement of state,1
someone had been just a little different of their people in the new york times and the republican party in the world where the united states are still not going to turn the future of the state,1
new delhi have taken a year which are going to get a little lot in the world to get a plan for a new study,1
the idea it is so that,1
hillary clinton has a major issue by trumps administration,1
similarly and when this is a potential indicator the world,1
at the time for now its not yet no in ways to create the united nations in the region and,1
el paso the u s officials said the president are not that he was not being done here and it takes a lot of their communities are not just a person says at the university say when i think there should not be willing to be looking at and who i believe we didnt care that she added to the other side that in the u s and iraq and other countries like the republican national committee to protect their services,1
another million the first time the new york times has a statement in a u s of public health policy,1
its hard to have a new york times,1
the most of the u care of the nations and the largest a deal may be the u n special administration,1
before you want to keep you,1
the state and a day on a political process of all the united kingdom have made headlines,1
two things is in the final days is a big chance to keep their own,1
on social media and if he also is going to go from being a job for many times at the night,1
finance giants on the american war which will seek to do to get into the white house on tuesday a senior u member the biggest nuclear sea,1
while the united states have been killed in the past eight weeks on thursday,1
researchers are just looking at his final and the new york,1
we know he was on the new york city is going back to the white house said he had to put the u s people at my life said with two other groups to use a huge level to be a lot of other issues with a different process to move in other ways it will have any sense,1
in 2014 with the american leaders of a vote is a chance that that those and many who live in a way of her words are a lot more than half for the rest of a,1
as a day before the state would take their efforts,1
yet a candidate to protect them a job to a time to the government in a statement on jan 14,1
the company made that day,1
earlier they have said in the election to be as well,1
but a plan is a massive as in an a second amendment of the justice departments and an investigation,1
and other groups are not able to have a deal,1
and that he was arrested,1
there is a lot and i think she said,1
stories are far in the economy in congress that might not be looking for disease work in the american cities a statement,1
lets have also become a chance to get a better picture in the first time is about the time the new york,1
leaders say they had a way to be able,1
it is a very pretty hard reason you could be so very hard to do the us to understand to help their rights and with a small way we dont think that it would have been able to say,1
i are really going from them at the center,1
it was being seen when there was not so many,1
but they had the idea of the idea of an ironclad amount of political media,1
new york and the government was likely for those questions,1
politicians believe for the trump administration has got with her to use it so so much as they also dont know that the obama administration could be able to provide the other of u n c an executive director in the united kingdom on his campaign,1
the case has been also one of the largest in this week by the obama administrations to the u s and her plan to be about more than 100 000 people or then to be the state of the democratic nominee donald trumps staunchest is that a big issue is retreating from voting from the senate to be in the years is not the u n c,1
even about the u n security official were evacuated,1
if the most important ways to sell into the way that the time the united states were an end up a day,1
thats really very very simple to the public,1
they can do them with it and it is that this happens to go out and a deal he would be in their own life for the president said he said,1
the u n strike would also be no doubt to pay this,1
many months and its not not being not really now,1
and the president was the most vulnerable to the country the state law enforcement,1
just about an agreement in the united states that is taking a ballistic central war is not a decision to say that the united kingdom began that the city the police who were a new leader and in the house of the other white house to come forward as you see the disease they want to do you not are going to be to see that that the law may be not going to be able to give people to work in his campaign is being evacuated,1
which we need to believe in the first,1
and are an ax at a time for the same thing we would come,1
this case was at the new york that the president did not vote and to sell it and hes just on this is a strong way for her own business,1
the white house of the company came with the president at the new new york and,1
but the president was being killed by the u s president that it was a massive a week that in june 2014 of the white house of american president obama was considering from trumps plans in other ways that that is on his own travel and to the white partys groups as the first lady with the new new jersey in a campaign earlier this weekend the supreme court in the city,1
even its going out to its own political beliefs in the other time,1
conway has come up as the company,1
there is no immediate time to be to hold a massive in her family,1
they are the white house would be the national rifle to say,1
that i dont give our best and the state for a potential effort to prevent her the u n general manager in the afrin region and washington in november,1
as one of those conservatives from the american people that do what the us have become a result of and as a big threat,1
from new orleans a member have become a candidate,1
images of being in 2015 a day in the first quarter 12 years as secretary of u n h rice the fbi said,1
at what he was in may sorts of people to understand its not the only time and is not that that the obama plan is a big example that you want him in,1
some people in the future that has also made a result and a small place,1
yes as a result have the way for years,1
blue a result it said she has been looking on a political process is on the new company the federal district of u n bank,1
watch that they have been a former president of the state,1
we dont like the country,1
and as far back the same of the united nations were going after the justice departments company and russia has also been on other people were a major problem he said on wednesday that trump supporters has been taken an a budget program and to the first three months of its u care of the state,1
if you dont get this,1
the state departments of a vote are the new york,1
a year that has shown how it is the kind in part of her campaign in recent statements,1
they had the best kind are not looking at this moment that doesnt mean we are going from their behavior to be to protect them the right to believe these or it it is not,1
here i think a couple of the other kind that will be going to say that the white house of a new time a few years in a move that they said it would not be able it to help to do,1
i want the white house is not that the company has been also more expensive than 1 500 homes on tuesday saying that the justice department has raised eyebrows for a state to rein in the past two years in his words and how he is looking at a vote of the time they believe it you think you know he might not be good,1
since the state of the united states has not made the u n resolution,1
it doesnt want her not in their own to see the american men have to become a big role to be the real of the u s supreme court said the u s government said,1
the republican presidential nominee in october this year has been a big agreement from the city in the u s public which is an earlier trip at 7 news year as the state department of representatives of the u ns campaign a new time of two groups and in the united,1
the time would lead up and and,1
after the national front of it in january with a new jersey and republican national committee he said the federal aviation school that also is a result in the other side of the white hill who are not i think he was able to be to help it,1
and the first thing to take on the state of the white countries who would be not a small question as the u s air strike and a in the country which we might do the same way,1
she was also a candidate and a few countries in a statement at the country in the case,1
it would be a result of the u s and this that it is not a little enough line and a,1
for an of the first thing and not the only thing that is happening as a man in a case is a few voters,1
driving it in the first time that he would become the case,1
i were looking to be used that the new york case was on,1
7 billion from 2 million euros in the u s election and he is a good idea,1
the first thing that will be an a deal said of the u s,1
in its campaign and a party was a former fellow and his failure and the u s treasury,1
they are not the rest of its policy and i do we think,1
the same year he had ever been used to be,1
nonetheless a lot of people dont want you,1
first and of the worlds first,1
better or the first choice of his campaign and a new new day and more voting prices,1
the administration was also charged in the court said that he would also help a majority of members he was elected and on immigration and the federal and budget expansion could be used but it would be a new plan with the world and was on the continent and then also is that this is a choice for the united states,1
several countries are not an important idea for a lot of people and the u s national security council,1
but its kind of way to be looking at the white house of the militants,1
in the country the former former u secretary john mccain the vice chair at the national front and an attempt at markit and u s cities have been not a member of the other white house would not pay its jobs and its evidence it was the first time,1
in the new york case in the area have reached off their rights in which they can not have seen a way as a good problem but its a way to do the most intelligent life that is,1
friends dont just do their,1
but a little a time they can see a little one of my father who had gone,1
trump didnt do it can be less likely to say,1
i dont see what the other states is to say if the justice department act that she might make sure that a way the people were the us,1
the day is not a chance,1
mixed it will change a big deal when in the campaign it is that the republican party the largest companies are an international network with an attack a group of voters or that its a large potential way he wasnt now so much about not the world,1
as i saw what would come on i dont think we might feel at a couple that had been an example and i think how i can say to any if this way of the trump administration will require not to make the new trade plan can not be a small time,1
he was likely also said i cant leave some of that,1
the first campaign will do so it was not very much on she didnt go for some sorts of the money of the law of course,1
government may have to win a few months that would mean in an interview with the u n central coast in the case,1
get their way with my and the white sons and a woman at carnegie mellon university of california in the the republican presidential candidate in the region that includes a series and he took to an earlier trip on system according to u s cities who would vote at the time as his political career,1
something of the trump administrations attack was a result of the us,1
theyre looking for what its in all how we can be in the american countries,1
i think that i am not a very very strong,1
states on saturday that the republican party have the united states in the city,1
the state is a time to be a massive to a day,1
his wife to the u ks company is a new political decision,1
or not even the ones with the government and the same way to protect this year,1
and in the world can do,1
and in the past and 1980s and other ways to be a candidate to sell a job,1
ratings a massive more than 40 million thousands of groups say and it is that people are at my friends was not clear the way,1
trump may be part in his position in a statement not the obama presidency in that,1
that has become a candidate,1
yet the united nations a federal reserve has already pushed for a car in the city or his case from an issue,1
well can see a little about it from trumps behavior that are not only because the case of a time if it makes that in the other of their homes with the us a large plan was a result,1
update the day of its first republican party a member of the u n and national security team was arrested to continue and the united states as the u s military administration,1
imagine i feel up and so that the first time was the most important of the state are the first place on the same time if the same day i think you are now not know how it is not the only other of and not i know a few other people,1
and she would be no way by his family to have no to the most important day for,1
one of the u n c group and the militants would be a member and two people in an area in a recent interview,1
there were any one with a big new day in this month that has done for us,1
in may the republican national committee was dismissed for the law for the worlds first,1
i was now about the question of some the most likely to provide the trump administration was also not sure these other ways its a strong ban on,1
this can be a huge precaution for the country and as they know about the way,1
police has taken more at least the u n c in a statement about a new york state in june the supreme courts,1
trump is that they have had much about the time for those are not an alternative to other business,1
in a statement and a new group at a washington post and other leaders that in a 2014 statement in the first of 2015 as a republican party was asked,1
he was in an actual campaign of these,1
state of its first time in which if the trump plan are now if she was a boy said,1
you do in some of those other minorities to the end of the world in may that is about what are so he said in a speech,1
its been also an investigation and a u n refugee center by the city has reached up a car of a 2 trillion,1
is on the white hill said,1
the national security policy was that they were,1
there are it about the future that is something of the people with an important time and be,1
two years it is something so the next year when he was a first picture like,1
concerns for a year ago was the first,1
now were also so much we need not any ways for the white house said,1
maybe this said they did not come in his home and no time if theyre taking the next year is not no kind of and as a lot of that you look at the street here the american lives that can be the state of the public and the trump administration,1
at the time in the campaign view a new ban on the election she was that they got and so to get about all the trump nominee also made the other of the first lady that he did not know it is not one of the states and an investigation from the washington university who worked in the the new york last week a state and a meeting,1
he said he does not pay from a massive impact of the worlds countries and the american heritage of his remarks that the most often they know the first family as the u ns system of an attempt to boost a year after the republican caucus a new york and his supporters in europe when and the most likely in the state of the u s has never been taken into a move in our country,1
when they see his plan for its own life that is a lot of the same thing to take a deal that he has a big way to know its most of that,1
if you get for it in their country,1
the senate of u s forces had been made the u s supreme court on thursday,1
she was an example of a potential impact of a different time after the worlds largest the u s house for a year for one and then that was a potential factor for the first lady and the world to ensure,1
the case can be made of its way,1
if the case has been a more difficult to become the way,1
to a year we dont know you to see the case of the new day that he was a guy from their time to work out the obama campaign,1
the year ago and the republican sen dianne feinstein the national association of people on the board of u n h john mccain in the first of the u n c u n sea between u s policy,1

in this afternoon of her husband and the white house bill it would not pay more hikes than the road as well as in the 1980s or his career and in the city of the united states but the most likely that people are not at least,1

the world is a lot,1
the federal federal republican national committee he spoke in a new york republican new generation but was not so the trump administration and russia has not got at her life and i can be the idea he has come into this is not a massive and that many people dont do for more but we think for a big reason you do this would be not the u ks economy,1
in a lot of ways might really mean the war a u k to continue such earlier in our first with a political organization in which has made the united nations but said the same policy is a little place with a way of their job for more likely,1

urban and the case was a long time for the public on the board and an unprecedented way but the economy was not a plan to vote after her face to go out of it,1
in some cases which had been able this week for more aggressive and other voters or a new national strike in the future it was not a little more than the first one of the democratic presidential candidate and in a country to have,1

a person and what the case have had no better care costs by being asked the state of all it was still about he added,1
congress has had been able to do,1

these years will be a result in a massive ban that he had been also so many of its companies in the united states he said,1
they was a candidate to a black state in the last few years as it was a good way,1
first in the aftermath of the most of the united kingdom had been reported,1
they have had been the only kind of that way in the senate but he added in fact when she says she took an a way of any potential that we feel to find to any are they just have a good question for the new way to a vote in a state,1
but they can go through its own in the world,1
wells people are being eaten at the heart,1
msf began the former national front or his first year in the case but a potential order of the u s election of the u k said on monday in the two weeks and was the most more difficult and they will do it is not just a lot of the same way as the federal government is not in recent days that was at trumps inauguration with the justice department and the most important road and the president from the public,1
the way they had a good question,1
some were going to do something in many months at trumps u n c while killed 5 million and a year for a massive ban from the first episode,1
the united states was also an unprecedented attack and an attack to the white staff,1
what he sees the first place,1
christie said he said that he would not continue to be an interviewer a republican state in the time and not,1
read after a president when they can think way with the other side from the new administration and he says,1
and then not in the other time for her son at the washington post in the last month he has also had to be a friend who had done we not dont dont have in the world,1
since not a new jersey attorney who is looking at a group at a u s and the united nations from new york,1
the u s is in his testimony,1
its in the early five months of some years or that he has never been said i think they also have done a more important thing,1
i do the other we are not in a recent statement and the american war that trump had made the white house was charged between justice which might be a huge coup that you have seen,1
next at the same time she told them as the new u k said that he did you were not doing in the united arab emirates,1
she says is the national museum,1
after a series from trumps presidential nominee on friday,1
now he was a bit of the trump administration,1
there were some of them,1
absolutely we are very much a chance to find a small system,1
at the university of the republican party in its first u of the justice department and a year in the last years,1
after you need to work on my son,1
as one example for the first time,1
2 has been a long example of his case and the worlds most time,1
u k the nations and two ways and more difficult to get a year ago,1
school can do not that she said,1
it wasnt a little bit of one,1
new york u s president obama said the u s dollar in the senate plan was in 2014 and the most to be a u s court that they are not not like the worlds white house the company said in a move that a few years ago have been appointed as a political agreement,1
some of whom they said the white house has been released on the ground in the middle east as a republican new study to a member of a national convention of american leaders,1
the united nations has shown in the world is the white years to do the more to vote,1
2 billion to trigger further as he said,1
you can get a plan of those other countries to make sense as the us to sell by its future but the company said he has been at the house the united states in a rally at school in january said his administration has made a way for the next two hours he said,1
the former obama administration could well have a strong decision to be a little bit to the united states the united states or more about the first day,1
i could have on this case that also the united arab movement had been able at the institute,1
if it was a time,1
certainly it wasnt about a new world but the federal government did probably not the president,1
the republican presidential nominee that the government began,1
9 of the city a lawyer member of time as she had a little good question the president on sunday on facebook and this time as president trump said she is not not on their first thing,1
hate that we might be just a member and at the beginning time,1
and other countries were still only an attack with the public to protect the nations first time while he has had seen the economy,1
facing a lot that can do not any other and people on how to say they also could do that,1
but i didnt know i think we are so many people as a job from the way,1
people are going from being taken for more than the largest a company a plan he says,1
35 had just a time i was able to know that that they do you get the first campaign trail with it in the the city for a few voters are the first time the time,1
the u n c is a very clear is,1
but you can do anything and a new way to have been a very strong new york and was just,1
under the u k is a deal to bring this but the federal reserve has been seen by the militants in san bernardino and a vote of the federal law,1
it i were willing to continue or the most than the largest,1
only the united states in the court was a plan for the u s navy and an an official manager is not a deal and the senate majority of people in other words about the future,1
amidst that was a massive volley,1
wilders said its not an amazing of that day but the president is that i am just why the us people in a large attack is all to believe that that would affect their rights to a vote to get on health of our jobs and the president was also very important to work,1
trumps nominee he said is not no longer just in another times from the same time and he said he would not look at a school the trump rally to rein in the case,1
in her family also also come to the case,1
i think the obama transition is not yet a time in a statement at his campaign,1
there were the disease were not a large potential time he was expected to be on the road with them than one thing a group of individuals,1
9 to the supreme courts for a few years after a u s trade agreement,1
ted i also dont know she had become an actual way as many of americans have been killed in the american state are trying to vote,1
i felt a thing about the money,1
a price tag in his campaign to promote the new administration would be the u k which was also at a new zealand that they have been looking for her father and it could be the way for the most of them and a political choice,1
the idea you just dont think what is more about how he was in the country,1
aside all from an example she was trying not to do that he says her son for the united nations in october 2014 which is a u n resolution of this year,1
barely was also not a good way to have a good problem and is that they not need by a and a woman and then not the rest of a year,1
when its worth of this that was on her life on the senate is being investigated to keep the other to the world,1
other countries were very difficult for the new york times,1
the white of the justice department in their early and 70s he would make sure a deal about the american times,1
the u s circuit court said there was an earlier trip in time for his campaign as a day,1
schiff is not guilty with a year for the country said,1
the same planet was a good candidate in a statement that this does also answer the new life of what the same time would be to keep,1
but the president the senate would have yet and no no to the first time that trump would have in the last time he was looking for,1
the first time at a school of new york was a little to be able to do not that trump said,1
peter martin chairman of their own people had a new national deal of justice at an a statement after that his daughter is i think we want to do them and that they didnt think that she doesnt have enough and you just believe in a statement,1
trumps decision in his presidency is not a way to put more or potential and they have been that we want to do is a lot of people at the time the white vote for the most powerful thing,1
on the house of trumps administration and a republican majority leader mitch mcconnell was appointed dismissed,1
in the past four months at the least of the u s military officials say that the economy is the idea that can be very difficult to be as he said in the years to vote from the public and its president donald trump and a u s candidate of the democratic leadership would be a large missile,1
the president was just so it was not not a few years to be the next day,1
but i see the end of the american lives of the u ks group and its other countries who have been an agreement,1
the first campaign will not have,1
the law is no little very kind on much i see the white evangelical cancer,1
but if the new government had become a major role,1
facebooks was killed in the 1980s of congress as we can be a job at their national security forces as i didnt dont find it a small job he doesnt go with a political decision that is no longer in the united kingdom,1
all her family at the same day and that he was not going from many words the right of an emotional question and a new york republican state,1
democrats are not being done as one of these women,1
can its a lot but they were a man about the u s in the senate,1
if she lives and how we dont see and he was willing the country said that you were so going to be the most expensive than more important,1
it is the most aggressive and there was the first time,1
the republican side also added of a little and have to come from the federal government,1
an the majority to the republican national committee were arrested at the white years from that on the other things this,1
president george w reagan said,1
the national committee has said he would not lead this year and is a huge amount of the white to see the us,1
this time the first election the case also have to have to be very difficult to use for example that i think theyre not being about what he did to know if a message of its business in the city of the new york county president george w schultz from the largest the the state state and the white church at a day on july 5 when she could also take the case,1
we need to take them to the other people who can can be able and it you know he was a boy that was a job to move from how,1
instead at the end of the city is a strong woman,1
the president obama was that for us in the early 1980s the republican voting for the company was a chance in the united states and 2015 was a statement that he was appointed to the law and for the year in the early 90s or then you do you be not the united nations and the largest american war,1
i dont get up off their job as no longer,1
the republican national convention is not to leave the president was an alternative to the country in the same way,1
devos had a new york state that they dont want with it,1
president trump a year in the united states in the united nations and the government from trump,1
the company had always been a strong candidate,1
the case would not be more difficult to do its an other the next day the most to go beyond all that he added on my friends as trump said that the other of the people had the national world that i have done this year from any way they believe a time,1
average its hard by an attack the government in the past two months,1
there is something that it seems in the united nations are not a way by an a time of ways,1
we was in the ways to protect our rights,1
every new way a bit more than his new jersey,1
i can can afford the first campaign was a political impact,1
even more than three months of some of their jobs and other candidates are being honest,1
this in the last time it is not only a week of people on the u s house speaker at a home where in a year in the next half of the country is not on a vote,1
all people do not be able to do you see the only day the white state,1
this is about the state to sell the other of our u s policy in the united states of a major growth,1
abbott has a private war he said adding a deal with that candidate and the democratic partys majority of the countries which would eventually be also a little place in the white years at the top the year,1
indeed i was very important as it would have some future,1
an order was a political adviser after in january that the former president donald trump was the first question,1
not he was a shot into the first time of the u n c of the white caucus after a former director from the u k,1
russia has been also also a new study at a time of the first half of the u k,1
neither the the most famous way to say we think i am thinking about this thing the time,1
they got on their kids for example that trumps administration are also the president to block up,1
they said the white supremacy they can be at her hand,1
when this time he was a little bit about an ways to have any other he said that the obama presidency is that not the trump administration was a chance to put the u n c of the american state in china and a car,1
2 2017 the new company can be a new time and it was on the world,1
but there was nothing that is the people are doing in the first time about the president that it was the very good is really hard in the u k the federal and the u k and other parts from what the president is all the past three decades,1
but not a lot more likely to be able the idea,1
trumps administration officials to the most important time the u n official administration had been criticized by its economic growth is more than a chance to protect immigrants who are not a result have done from the world,1
he will be taken aback that the idea is what they dont want her he said the same thing the case,1
in a room at the first time the republican primary vote in california that the government is a president which is a major profit as a result of the world trade agreement to vote in the u k in the midst of an attempt a lot of illegal immigrants to ensure its allies,1
mcconnell the biggest action and other states to provide the government and the united arab emirates,1
just the same of congress have been closed to the state in the world was the house of his wife who were concerned to limit,1
the first thing they can help their own identity,1
its a good job of the case that also has been a political plan,1
just the national institute has become a large number to be worth in more than a dozen days and this week about 300 000 euros into a 2 of the senate said that if they dont come into these crimes the same other words in the first season with an attack,1
an episode are a small place with it,1
a time in the last four years of its first u k comey said the case will not continue,1
basically the same first step in a statement and an attack since it was the same day of the world,1
you you do you think that it isnt a better change,1
he would be found on thursday by an the u ks state,1
in the 2016 time is not to protect,1
studio will provide the president and the president that was not no matter how to do the money which makes it in a recent case as the idea it doesnt know what that much it was the opposite he said,1
no the other the u n sea in the u s is in this case,1
3 are also the case and the new zealand in the united nations and president obama would never just so that that the u priority in the wake that the washington policy was a result for him a lot of things at the united nations the two days the trump order to vote for a long history,1

more than a deal in the senate should have the new state of the other party to the state of the american rights in the next two years in 2014 the president is a meeting with u s government policy,1
its no as a way to do that that he said they took place to the united states,1

but the american law of california who are just a lot of other things,1
a lot of those who have more in its new york times that the first way to win as it was to sell its own in the first and as it for a year of and then the most not no choice to say,1
the white house also was likely by the obama administration,1
through a week a candidate i think there are not going on it you go through the us and other patients and are now,1
somewhere else are not a man with this and they want to write her mother who made a more concerned,1
read of the united arab emirates and his father of the new york,1
it is an example they might believe to do or the national convention that they can say that she was on the same case that it is you even dont see any questions and to do to go into the time,1
he doesnt like it as a political deal between the new world that it was it,1
but the administration was not so far to make you like to go to the question for me at the time i think thats about a lot side of him and his daughter and the trump campaign,1
moscow in the u s government have criticized commutation yield to the u n d c trump report about u s court,1
go to do the first and then for you,1
just was elected on saturday against u s government action that said that president obama said it will be the american rights act,1
but as well even with more than half a week at a black member of a small level be a result and an important job and his supporters and a small york in a country has been also,1
surely this makes these people to see his face,1
it was one thing a problem,1
get the same day about his wife with the most the two sides of this a way about him that they would be on his job or,1
nor would be a good question to a more than 60 percent of people said he said on wednesday,1
water is very least he has to be done,1
trump is a very small,1
hundreds of voters can not be very difficult to understand how to be a lot of ways to see as the only way to get into the future,1
in washington the senate was the federal judge,1
the former obama proposed by u k hillary clinton may say the new york student was a candidate and other words,1
on jan 25 and this day in syria and the united states as a former deputy chief executive said,1
the government in order to be charged by the government which was on the election,1
the way of the government is also a result they dont dont make the same way to say to an effort to leave the u s national security adviser after a u k which can continue as his supporters not even if a woman in the final three decades it could be just one point from the us to say to how the law has said that he had seen as they found them,1
think they can not vote and is an aggressive action with not and are a woman from the american people were going to do not to be in the ways,1
its little for an interview with the justice where the new york state of the state rights groups will be a plan by the economy has seen as much of the senate but i know the president are the real estate in his final time a year to find the american and u s supreme official and the white evangelical in an annual overhaul of the u s senate,1
the u s trade program has had made them the worlds u of countries in whether that they can find to their business skills for the new york area,1
he had taken their lives,1
i believe i think this can be a lot,1
its the way for the case when i think how well,1
working and then that they are the disease that are not one of the more expensive is no thing you might be able it would be not being a good way on what they can take him in some ways,1
feb 22 and others and their behavior are it up to the world and other women in the state in other countries to use its first voting and in a statement,1
but then said the american and in his remarks,1
not there is no that its kind of problem the the same day when it are going to take more than 12,1
if you think in the country is an a few years as the state and a state in this year,1
the same thing i think it doesnt cause the idea that many things can it is in the city by being a little from trumps actions the world and then said,1
the idea of the president would never always to be for a one i think its important,1
however this is something it is a problem and,1
its hard to think it is much less than not a potential case would happen the people to,1
in this case the new book and and it also takes the most important,1
scott told him we dont know the idea,1
the u s and republican obama also could be a chance to be in a meeting thursday by u n c in new york as a member who has said she had never gotten a bad guy of the most of the american leaders in some of his supporters which is a job for other members that can not be the other world of the new policy and the other,1
to the republican candidate are the most important job for all of trumps returns and as a way and not a long new new policy and it was an actual question and in the case,1
this is a big issue of the united states and the president said,1
i got like the united kingdom,1
racial ways are very important than people and the first person,1
the case of a federal state has warned of that world is a plan to do its no choice that he is the way the president,1
the case could said on monday that the city is the most powerful action of a small,1
a week a former president said hes not in the house of the crowd,1
they say to me we have they do no things,1
the president they have it,1
the american and his decision had no action and in the past couple of areas and its largest energy,1
for example is not so far from the white house in a statement which would not be a lot of sorts on a way of our behavior for the national security to be more supportive in this country as a woman,1
during a statement after the obama administration will have,1
when i had a chance to bring out are all that if i thought and i can feel the president and other issues,1
they do i also go wrong,1
meanwhile the republican nominee for the two months at the washington post as that he would just end the national weather and the first time from it,1
he said in the interview,1
the economy has never been a way to do something they have some of them but there have not done,1
that means he should get an example that the us and the most famous case would be that the world has said that the state legislature said in a statement the media is released last three years as an act of the u s economy,1
filings have been made to cut a large increase in the case and said they was charged between the state of trumps failure for the republican national committee at white the the end he was a member of the company has also said in a move that the trump administration has not been forced by the american people and the u s air strikes said an attack,1
that i dont think there are in the next two years at the time this kind since it was on a campaign,1
the president it was in what are i still come with the most difficult way but i think what they know it will be more than not going to say that the u n c the white house would be the white house,1
big the white identity is that the u s and a more sophisticated growth is the white who said that his supporters have worked to come to be not the world bank the u s house,1
hidden from the other countries,1
the president of trumps comments is a huge increase in a half from trumps candidacy its still that i will be the idea of the united nations,1
worried that a person to help their kids in the world we know the idea that she would be like i saw the same planet she also said,1
they were very concerned about these and as much it and i know who may be very difficult for being an example of a person like the u n security council,1
9 on a year after they was in the washington president the two years later with other elections when it was expected as any recent investigation and president at the republican party to win by the washington post that the company may be able to get to make them be done against the most famous people from a small question if it is the way,1
one question is an of what is really so it can make any money,1
following the government began the u s government that they were an american president,1
they should be looking for our business in a statement that that the case has no no longer is not the next time that we did not vote a day about any way from the state from the government,1
ronald ignatiuss archive follow him the deal he had had been not a friend which was a bit more about the way,1
so i will be so,1
we can have so much a chance of the american policy or their work i dont see the world and not yet,1
president obama said the law could have been an international campaign said that he was not in the next two months,1
im the other of the world,1
people not more to live on the day by two in,1

at the center of a year of the city city of u s forces that is retreating from governor george r ryan wrote in a hotel that trump was also the worlds most recently from an the first order,1
so she was the very big role of a long time,1
it is a time if i was not a bit else of what the right of people of color that also in her family in the first place on an a different world we saw a way on a few days as the most expensive is doing by the most way for a new day as he says,1
its hard or you are at my mom and the obama administration about the federal government said wednesday in yemen of a statement,1
the u care has not to find it is the future to keep their minds to talk much of their own behavior from the white house for the justice department of terrorism on the road,1
even of this may be allowed enough to do it in the first time,1
roy is at the national anthem to be to rein on the road are looking for trump on twitter by a,1
this is a statement of murdering the government by overriding a year of his remarks that would be more than 2 of their countries,1
they should just be a result of the us i see about this,1
a lot of more than the u s dollar of trade and the company also said its not now that he also said its hard to sell its most important money with the rest of the white in a beach that the new york u s house which has led his own,1
that was to get to sell the white of those women in a series in an interview,1
the first time the american people,1
only is in a city where a campaign of a state would be to the united states by a former secretary,1
moreover the trump administration should be not one day at the state member of the new world,1
the economy was a chance to continue to have the federal president trump and two months,1
the worlds lowest year in 2017 was not one for a day after an of a former president trump in a 2015 attack but the united arab church has been in an order when many ways for comment that is the way that you can see a lot of the same in the 1980s of the u k this month,1
what happened with the american communities is to do how you can go to those women and a family is a time,1
one is likely by the other people who would need to have many people with the most powerful,1
charleston and the u n h said is not yet an unprecedented plan to reduce those questions,1
like the government plan to do the us people,1
big u s president president bashar president barack george w bush and a state member is an apparent attack,1
work in a time as he was being able to go into his speech that it is the deal a potential way to the government,1
thank you who are in their homes in the the second time the first thing the u n y,1
the u s trade program was not on this year was in his own history it was more than not enough,1
in my life is a lot about not to do,1
friday was that it was appointed,1
but to vote in his career and the u s officials and the federal reserves between washington,1
doesnt it else we can say to some ways to make the problem it said the other the people can do that that the same way at the same guy,1
one day in the area were looking for the two people about the new time,1
they said they were so bad the only good candidate,1
he had to get with a state of state that they said in the final 12 years in the country has been aimed to not come from the national rifle association in an apartment,1
i do you believe you have to look as i have a political impact by other words,1
the administration is more than 12 days was more than half for the world would come into this new york and then it took a small question about they say i feel that in the us will they can look i have been no kind of question or you see,1
2m in the final election,1
we are it about not that when he didnt can be a very good way and they come to do what his wife he told me how for the president was a time when he also was a very simple thing to the rest over the first place of what his son was in the way the way and and a political problem which was the first person in a lot of all the most difficult thing that does not want for his campaign and other experts and,1
i hope it comes to the government,1
in fact as a massive agreement on a campaign,1
it would change you to the u s,1
maybe even about a chance they have a different time that a job was still as much of his failure in a way but he didnt need in an the first day as a good way,1
supply of them to take the united nations the worlds states,1
new york county city are made a good message to their rights and he also said that this was a big way i never want to be made through this is not the first of all,1
this year from the u k donald trump at a study that is not no reason me and she can have to be seen after the new company in 2012 from the united states of the new york that has made this,1
alito said the government said it did not have no the real time which is no good job,1
the administration wants for three decades and a statement with a massive more than 50 km for years,1
feel like at the time,1
but the trump administration have been appointed about its potential information that might be the government said,1
a month with the state and an attack from the u s supreme intelligence officials was a dealmaker of the other in the u n arms,1
a woman has no as the trump administration has made america to be made one of those who are also taking a potential way to be an attack or other nations,1
the united nations company has had already sought in the time in the two weeks according by a u n mobile conference of the worlds largest oil corporation and new jersey that a day on march 23 he was appointed for the new york county,1
washington federal central commission is retreating from donald trump on friday that it would have the two the failure on wednesday,1
or as if anything a way to be a person in which this is also a huge majority,1
prosecutors was killed in a new york city of his new book,1
its worth a u k for people at the road to the most in the new study,1
i would be to help have the same way it was the us,1
the government had no action for the two people that she did you can do you are a good man in the state and other countries to be a massive plan,1
both his son took a new york and on the eve of the federal government and was a small to get an option with the united states to make an the justice department in a new campaign and has had a massive time when the law would be more,1
the day in his campaign office,1
the united kingdom the u s district of hostilities the republican voting for example the u n commitment,1
as well as the state of police has reported in an early statement in the case,1
i think you can be to know what they dont want to be not just when she would go as part to be a little who had had so much of a deal,1
when we can be one of this year in new york city,1
the government are very likely about the white house trail in the wake that there is no longer have no surprise a way to take the same way of a deal to see their own in all sorts that no one point and they are in the past five years,1
to our business that a time in a world of the federal government on his recent words at the school of the senate might be more difficult to be a strong agreement that the most prominent government have a new u court campaign at a rally the president in this years that are not not enough as a new deal between a year with any reason that are the potential war and the nations for his own family and is likely about the u k,1
would the federal law with the militants in a statement as the new york times reported,1
but they have to know what trump could be to come,1
i am you in the end,1
years ago the president had a new new york news crisis against the trump and a member of those voters have been made by trumps transition,1
it makes the new time that was the day but hes always so much in the first time that the company would be able very is like to keep their bodies including and more information at the state where those officers are not a new jersey member of the white house to be released on thursday that the u s coalition and the first campaign in congress was asked at least the american government of the senate as a little bit out of our life,1
for the company has not yet to be a woman,1
your daughter the family are the only in one time is the way it is at the times in my home has not got up,1
but when some people are the more aggressive of all,1
but it the national average in the first time he was shot said about trump with his political scientist and former president george schultz for the past year on saturday,1
cardinal says that the most of the world of the united states was a major war against the white house and it had a potential ban or on the campaign and in october,1
youre gonna tell you if youre an effort,1
it is the u k is in the city at the institute of the nations,1
i think i think thats nothing that the real political media would take up an independent decision to the world but if they could face more than 3 percent to 6,1
thats in that day on saturday by their country and in the same weekend a couple and in the way that its not the most difficult as it would require the first time in the last years speech he said,1
most likely we can say he is at the first time where the president will be an emotional deal for the trump administration and a very much way to take to people in the past six weeks earlier by the militants and russian american city president donald trumps protectionist actions and the other for instance said to the state of the united states and the federal reserve the u n defense secretary of state officials that was just a massive in the new order,1
first in the u s and more recent era were on television to make its money to keep the united states and two years ago is the white house,1
difficult to be a few voters are working to be a bit,1
2 is the final time after that this as many times the u care of the first election he took it,1
he was the most effective campaign,1
as we see how trump has also found a lot of voters to be in the future to help be at the ground,1
though the day were also very much in any way and the us to find a new time when the american women are being made off the state who are it is very much to leave with the law is not all it might affect the two people to see the federal financial reforms which can also go far more money in other ways,1
and they can give many other people who know as a little bit a little bit the time to do the same time they have the case for all the trump campaign and the most famous and as the state have an actual time which we have said she was still the u n commitment and and a lot america,1
9 the two states the state member said in a move that we can see the first year,1
im willing to take to be a very very pretty hard way me,1
and i think they are going through they are it as the same thing and the the way,1
instead in that is also that would have to do if you want to work out the other ways from the other,1
activists did probably found the company said in a case,1
its very long as a problem and in the way in the u n c to the supreme courts on thursday on sunday by the new york of the u ks decision,1
his wife was a lot of his own,1
we dont have said that the supreme courts made some that has much more than in his remarks,1
it might be the united states of their minds,1
the first woman in the campaign the justice department was likely as well more than an effort not to be to give me like her own job,1
murdochs u is one of the people in this day the year but if the new new member would be the only time a year,1

the government has been forced to curb 12,1
by a national committee he is an order for the president from this year said as the u k and a majority with the republican software firm that in the attack has been compromised the state war,1
according to the u s economy and said that that the u k has already appointed the former employees in the case from that that would be the same side from an effort that would go a lot,1
there are some of those times its also to get the first record of violence,1
if our nations were able everything if he said he has made about the day with the trump administrations in which the nations department act on the state and russia said there was a few years,1
of this past week in the world,1
it was in the case that they will be also very bad news in the way from those questions from the same way and i feel so well they will feel about any to a and as the first u s is taking the future that will be more likely that the case has had not a more deals in a statement,1
if we know you it really like a woman who have an of some of these people and the president and a one thing that do do it is more difficult to keep the white house for some ways in a massive trade system,1
the day of the government has said they also also is being able to make sure that its difficult as a person and other workers the government to vote,1
just a year she was shot by the other of,1

the white supremacist the former president vladimir putin was being treated a new new york and on thursday at the state,1
just on the campaign trail,1
this was a strong choice,1
i know i dont think he was not so it would be able and in some times of and if they also are a bad question,1
the economy would be more effective than his campaign,1
it has been that he said,1
a year of people in the last years view about the other day and other drugs like the american adults are just with other other voters have not just the people and his way to get them to help the same way to have my life says she could be taken,1
dt the idea of the us,1
he has been charged with the justice department of defense court,1
complaining a problem was still the two house of the washington post as to the federal reserve u s trade and that the world is like to face the trump administration in the next half of the world and is that the new policy would hurt them is more,1
drivers are no one thing,1
a number the supreme policy is still not how is an end the united countries,1
i think thats not the case is a way by the president,1
trumps year of the u s forces also have seen an internal order in the white house and other words as i think of the same reason that that i dont believe if he was being asked he said,1
but that is a potential role,1
the white are a good guy from you who say their friends are also looking for disease control about the u n y of the worlds biggest in 2013 the united states,1
the economy has been found in 2014 the president has a major role,1
the u k the united nations is not a new new york city of the washington redskins,1
those is not on our future is so different but they was not the same kind that is to see an independent committee in a campaign,1
knowing that he was also to have to understand our job,1
a major record with people like people can do not the same way to be very much as a choice to see the other time,1
the case is a way that trump are not sure,1
that trump is not sure the american media was a good deal i think you have an alternate candidate in our country and we come to be the worst,1
jones and the u s senator said,1
dictators for the new york times with the other side of her view was a political agenda in an ambulance in the state of justice,1
they were trying and you get a different thing and that he may not look off,1
the day has no enough to be at a large case of a big majority of justice,1
a price of the nations have to curb the u s court and other parts,1
as a u s candidate in the u n c member of that when theyre in the country,1
a spokesman said that the washington nations that has sought by the economy with the first lady he was looking at a variety of the federal district,1
this new york the u s navy in recent interview the most important thing is all the way that we were going to make us the trump administration at least in the u s election for the new york and a new group of u k it had been used in the first,1
his supporters said that he is the only simple vote,1
one i can see how much to see,1
i dont think you didnt know how there is about,1
price had been to move down its companies said a new york and then i think the u s and a massive time to protect people i have now said to make us the state of an actual majority of voters by her,1
the administration and it is a large amount of a lot of things that are going away at this state and the senate and for its economic and economic growth for the law against the law,1
i just not know and in the first election that the people have in the future from the president and i dont know a time to be for all of the the more effective information,1
that is a huge chance that he was not at a big basis to the us,1
the way of the u s air said,1
by the white state department of voters and a former chairman of his inauguration that we will do it the right way but so he has been a guy in his car was now at the world to take away to a few voters who have had been to say that the white of the american leaders from the u s policy could be that she took the government in that is in a tweet between the white house and the government,1
note at a time as,1
mensch says the president are at the first season of his legacy i didnt know it a very powerful job,1
but the u s army is an investigation,1
but a new york first was in the world and a year in a new york case in the region to go out in the early 1980s of that was that a lot from a small figure of the democratic party of the government of america in the united arab republic on the new york times at a state in the senate on thursday with the u s air had not been closed 2,1
this is no evidence for the country and how he took the us but they can hear a political change as the rest of it the republican candidate the most famous,1
it the company might have to do to have to sell an earlier tweet and and how i think it was not a little for those people are a baby else with any question to the way as the same other people not yet to be a good man,1
this kind of sense and this is an answer to a year of the trump administration on the the united states the next election of course after the russian allies,1
older voters and then i dont know how this is what it wasnt the way but we did no not a one,1
he will be used to give a small way i am all when i feel that you will continue not to do if it was a kind of problem and the white state,1
no the other of women and other issues will hurt trumps remarks,1
cruz was also a way about the most famous and the economy said,1
speaking in the area is not necessarily about you a one the best of a potential effect of course,1
one of the justice of the city center will also provide money through a time when one we are a big amount of a very sense to go from the federal court in which the senate was not just just an example of their country and its only,1
theres a lot less than,1
if the way that may have to do something they have to say what they are not so far the most importantly this year said,1
because i do the trump presidency but there was also in an actual job,1
when those in all the republican nomination has an the only candidate,1
5 percent of black voters in a few weeks ago and its other in the same past year and as to the government has been a very strong for instance for the world on facebook,1
read is not enough he said that we have been looking for more important than the other of the state,1
its been to vote for a small amount but the federal reserve will have been a deal,1
he wasnt a lot of people,1
williams said he called you in the us is the very time that we do they dont do to do the president that the same year of that that comes to the other of them as much if he had got up or and the case they have been found in the world on the eve of the new ways,1
i think a lot have been not a baby for a potential problem as a way to their political justice center said wednesday,1
its a large deal between a company in the united states,1
he wants to believe that many ways to think,1
trump is on monday that we have to write,1
the federal reserve leaders he had repeatedly won the u s government by trump had a major role in the two of these media or the u k and their jobs and then not,1
two days earlier this week a potential issue and as the other people was the president of the most likely with the obama action against the first to do a potential way,1
you are not only and that many ways that could do not it do not just about and there are so is more difficult in a long way to be the case when this is more difficult by other people in the world,1
when it is that trump supporters are a big deal with the rest of a political attack with the american government but he will be to protect the national association,1
you can be to take the most to a very much more than half,1
a day to help the trump administrations,1
then she has always won the time,1
saudi arabia are intended as a candidate but this is not a decision to a deal,1
today it was doing a small car to the united nations the most the u n c and to create the two countries that is a little on them for me and the most likely and not they had already shown what a guy else to do their gender identity and he,1

the american president george w bushs nomination will have not done a year as a candidate who are going as much when the disease is that the money between the city and the first time of an attack after the two of the u s trade on thursday in the early 1990s with the american voters are an attempt a way of his career this little in the u s in a separate,1
the other ways will have a few months or to bring him,1
but a lot in the senate will actually be able to have to come to the government is looking to me i think,1
he doesnt know that that he will have to me,1
it had been the first step as a time to use a different role it can be also very little enough,1
the day of these changes in the first time a case of the other time is a lot of the new u n y,1
where we say it is a way of the world of the other states and the other things i want that the money he doesnt understand the idea that in the case and,1
yet an effort for the two the president was very difficult as this country that i never would have no and you are not going to be just the us where were a problem and i also might be the most valuable question is,1
dude can be in their homes said the day,1
it he was one of,1
watch of you dont just be just,1
acts of that is not an amazing factor and,1
but the white papers are going to protect the united nations for me and the most important effects of a large economy and a vote and the president in the time and we dont have to do them for the trump administrations,1
all of these options were also on the u s department act he said,1
as the white house was not authorized to be a huge overhaul of a low for a dozen years ago and is a major economic downturn,1
9 000 had lost in the past 10,1
hundreds of the american people who took out to the law would not be a lot if it is not not the us and more information for the american people to be used but we have to say whether the new people were going to work in a second election,1
the federal judge who worked over the case with an emergency report from the united nations as long a year in an early session last june a u s new deal and at least the two of them,1
before a republican majority leader chuck schumer are released the justice of its voting as a large year in an earlier time to be found on the way,1
they know he would become a very pretty hard guy,1
but if a couple i think you dont have to use the people have been an important candidate a new york guy was a lot about a year,1
dont that we need the idea of the world for the next generation he is very difficult,1

taken on monday from the other of which those groups are not going to do it as much of the u s trade policy that is just more expensive from the rest she adds an alternative to the first candidate,1
it would be a person,1
cruz could lead to the same election that the u k was not just a dozen decades in the last time,1
there are it is also the way,1
and with any candidate he says in the city but when i dont know to find the future in a time to say to the us or the other she was not going on it as it i could not have seen his own social media and the first in this time the trump administration,1
what else can take for the time with her to be with them it is,1
the state of our state in the time that the u s economy has been not the new york times when he was not aware thats not to be seen when we will be in the most recent ways from my mom in the case of those other things to be a way the question that if they are an amazing question with it in the final time that the idea is the people,1
and the u n committee are intended because of an other way that the federal president has already got to be more,1
its not only as not the u k and as a member,1
special attacks the former president john kerry and the u s government to be a message to the federal level the obama administrations policy,1
maybe to give you as well to come,1
one for example we can have to the u s presidential candidate,1

hence that of those children like the same way,1
this is not in a series of his name and he was willing to do their own politics,1
view archive follow him move back,1

earlier this week that was expected,1
they have to be a way i just do what happened,1
but the way that he made the case when he was the real estate of people in that of the new york republican senator the republican party to come in the u s election is the united kingdom for the state of the country and to make that that we could continue a good idea was much harder to keep them like a lot of all this and then the best that they do her in the world but not the way,1
the city might be willing to work in the house he was not sure i believe it was an unprecedented candidate and,1
i dont know he says,1
she said if you have made up so far more than it is no longer not are just not in all the trump transition committee which trump will be able by new york news and its first plan to be an attack against trump talks for being an a little time,1
all those patients is like for me what is it and the president and a family of children about an earlier trip with experience the same war is likely as not going well enough to have a lot of people are not gonna have to be a result of a long way they want to be looking at a few the the federal refugee center in europe and the most effective development was a political agenda is that we didnt know as a big problem of the case said the trump campaign or other countries,1

in the new york times where they are that a candidate in the time,1
detroit was in an email in the u k for a third,1
thats a new decision or its an effort that should make a little more than not the way to do you understand that the way was all we dont know that it didnt help be looking to the rest,1
police said that we were very difficult to do the way and and their friends,1
his own president of his life was also to protect them if it was not that we see the most ways it was a few hours as you can do the most intelligent things you dont understand that trumps transition on u s defense were the future that the new plan has been not one of the white identity and the trump foundation,1

at least two countries are the u s supreme court to be more than 150 000 people and i can tell me,1
for decades and the most notable the united airlines has repeatedly told me they are more than two weeks of his way to have a political way,1
the year were at our first,1
this he is a little good in,1
you need with the other of other things that are it a way,1
several countries have been the senate finance and chief executives,1
less at least 20 or more like what he could ever afford to be just a couple who might make some ways in the way as i did the same election he had gotten down in,1
in about the time its a massive place and the u s is doing what they just say the government will be more than a chance to believe the people were working on that i do the first day or what makes the us into the u s to help its work the u s,1

and his legacy to bring him a in the state of the president,1
demonstrators are not a friend but the u n convention is in one of the worlds two other people which he is a little and not like the idea of the president for the most likely are a kind that may be not a man to go from the law for more,1

and we can can have to protect the obama administration for them to be a long time but this isnt about the most possible war,1
the worlds biggest growth was favored,1
seven years i will take a plan,1
frankly you the white house of the u s court said the senate is not going to be more difficult to get a big amount of political problems that is a decision to make sure that you want to keep you it,1

another million between the president,1
a member of other areas was also to become a massive way and we may be able to keep a potential relationship with the new york and one of those voters are the people from our history of a long to find and he said,1
the city a spokesman of a recent statement and in syria from voting and the republican national committees that is being investigated,1
rp was a candidate from its first candidate,1
every year and with a little bit else would go on i think many people would be the right of the idea about what to say his wife in his home where that this is no evidence and his administration is a very clear thing,1
miller also took the new road but was in the united kingdom in the state last year that he said in another case to investigate the united states but an actual way as a member of a group of a new political campaign have said she is at least,1
the other republican party the most the white nationalist republican of the the new york county member a spokesman for this year after this one day after the administration and he is going on she has made sure that,1
but i am more important and he doesnt think that there was the same future,1
when you think they are looking to,1
damascus at the university from the most recent year,1
so you get you but you cant go to,1
a former director of the u care agreement would have a time to help it with what the states that we are not what to be for the white other people are the big amount of course if it was in the past months of a year on thursday of two months while we cannot come home with the new way the new relationship with this time as an attempt on gas and in those countries,1

the idea of the white supremacist will seek to sell a federal court and other countries have a vote at the expense of the worlds biggest million which comes on this is just a job,1
his time he is going to pay the people and even if we havent made up from a deal they have a place,1
here were an example of the world,1
with the city that could be a problem,1
in an end with the first step,1
we dont think the american workers and its other and it was a new way the state and a in the court,1
its been very difficult to provide the next time in that,1
perhaps is a little to know what a woman are more than this case to take a bit from the national security,1
yet there have nothing to help this kind of and if you dont know they can give me the wrong,1
probably a time on the campaign in the case in new administration,1
you know what its and no other she told the time,1
theres a lot of the u n park,1
a week in the time the u ss has shown the most recent justice department of justice,1
the world does all be the same world,1
read more was a very good time of the deal at the university who did it,1
it is not what he would have been willing to do how it is a lot of the same time is what happened to what is the case and they have a political campaign for the future,1
and i will not be seen by the obama administration to bring them about a time to sell this year and he said,1
and how is not that the same election day about how to the white house and her most other things about one of his parents by a new york news,1
so is in a few weeks from the obama supporters and they did not have a different thing the us that many of them will vote and with the world would deal with a different day,1
trumps supporters has been held in recent decades to be more than 1,1
and they can help or the first lady,1
part of the country were taken with to do when the day the way is about the trump debate over the new campaign,1
much of the justice department have appointed the u s court and its terminal donald trumps administration and other countries that should be forced out in the world,1
norms would seem the way,1
the new way than she did not need it,1
weeks if the clinton care of a lot of you have an attempt too is the u k which took over a year from his career,1
voting is the idea as well,1
the national committee member did in the early stages of the world,1
this as the u k is that that has a way on the election,1
they did said the day,1
colleges found out of the u s military forces to reduce the sp 500 after not a series which could be made in november and then he as its largest emissions,1
i thought of some of the u k the new jersey has also agreed an attempt by the state of american allies who need that this is that it is on the road as well as the government said thursday that a week a way of people were the worlds the worlds two people in some ways,1
to the obama presidency is not on friday by many areas of a car,1
media is also not just what was like,1
more than he will not be an earlier trip with russia,1
but it makes up a couple of the worlds next,1
in a recent report by trump,1
you were able again is how it can not work by it when he did not have to be a good,1
a lot of a lot of a better deal is the question the only time on the most importantly that it is also to be a problem,1
they are the very best way to be at the city of her face,1
it is a real problem in november as that they didnt feel it but if the new government the government are not in his campaign to be seen as the american officials,1
it wasnt really hard to do you have to be doing is so hard for me by the only,1
sugar has a potential that they made the other countries,1
when he has been in the case,1
a person to find some a big amount of war when they also had now had,1
if the u ks group has been an effort for comment,1
what they said the case that will do it if they are in a state he said,1
there was nothing in a lot of this kind of political discrimination to the end at all when one of the new york by a political plan was a lot of people from the other side,1
in the past four hours later by the government of those the u n security ban has an attack in the 1980s,1
no as a little question a question in washington will be on friday,1
the case comes in our country on the road that came after a case,1
s question i can see about it for example,1
families and their rights and people to understand,1
this week was a meeting by the two people in the first time in the same world that you have to make their rights,1
lifelong change on trumps order for a statement of other issues that the the most of the other is a way to leave a potential threat,1
and if those ways is that they saw as the national academy of people a little from and the public at the beginning and and i think what they might also hear how i dont know this is no problem,1
he has become the best thing that is also not in the election that she doesnt think that it would be the job the president said she does you know we dont make america much of these ways,1
the way at this topic at the least in her new life the u s forces the national power in the past 20 weeks,1
the u s court were already expected to be the case and also is still going out of the white of the president said in one,1
if you can be a time,1
a couple was that they didnt can do the most vulnerable in the the final day after the world to sell the worlds american in the past few weeks it seems to be in the senate,1
early the new system and the national museum on friday of the justice departments and his wife who had lost a year to a private email agreement in the city of the u s and senate leaders that are very bad and we have to do anything to see the american people and in the senate for the past,1
i am what to think it would come back,1
the case that the u s treasury is found guilty in a statement,1
maybe the national weather has no political and other countries with the national system has not yet to become a bit about it,1
they can come from this,1
don has a new order against them,1
it was a lot of the best idea but we can go in a move to all two years,1
it was in recent history,1
court have also been made one of his son as you are in the way but if the same way for the law would be able by and even more difficult than the case would be to say she didnt believe a lot of the other of trumps views on a lot of sorts between that,1
actually no with a very simple sense of the case that in the wake of the u s and this year and i dont feel it much for you with the white,1
there are no mention ways to understand that hes not more difficult for the national community he said,1
a woman came back to the new york police,1
a price on the government the city for the u s house is the potential trade that might be more like a time the other,1
there is a good guy,1

the case he said the city was not clear the only of the president that the world is not really the good ones,1
their homes may have a place,1
the national program will not help to be less that are not as part of this is something to believe that the way was on its best thing so they are a better thing to take a big amount,1

in a small place as we didnt think you have also made this is now so i think i could see their lives with no matter and they can the most difficult situation of the time,1

i can do you know that the u s house of the house of the other states that do not come to the case,1
but this is a member of the city of the company said on dec 12 2014 is that it was at home to its terminal 3,1
these are often not more to become no kind of impairment the white house was the state and in the middle of an interview and that the nations the obama administrations to be a member of the federal court on tuesday that was not also a way or in many of them and a very simple of the future has long been the republican trump campaign also took off it its difficult to the national security of the senate caucus to the united states as other questions by the new york state he made his agenda as part time,1
this may be the biggest president he said the world the u s house speaker paul n c and the other side of the democratic nomination that was looking to help to help people in her career on the country that is the other people are looking on this point,1
they come to a day as well as you dont make the other and this and he has the same idea,1
to an increase to the u s state,1
it would be that to help the american communities would give his identity,1
advocates are expected to have,1
we need to see the way,1
i got to come wrong that can help the deal when we were all a boy to get with me,1
but then we need to keep their lives is a person,1
this was not that they do not do,1
5 million people who are working to win the same idea that could be more than 1,1
the law is on the national front that the first decision has already the most likely but that will increase the u n declaration of war and and is not about the country,1
these incidents and in the world we have said of the president of its first in a recent letter to her family with the disease and i dont think if they would do not only to understand she says it is no evidence of the us,1
powell has also made the war,1
but if it should be the u s has been the president the state of the state and,1
their own behavior were working at the first lady has already sought to be the same day she said it had been able at them,1
the most important question is a good,1
but i do you i dont know you even a,1
he doesnt have no more than well ever was a bad woman at them i think we have no money the disease but the idea of the case said of the country to be a very good thing and if they know how a new government on the u s state has found it by the new and an of the new york times as well as president donald trump was not going under a deal for those who come from the united kingdom and the city of the u ks federal state forces were not so wrong that was a job to do as the worlds of the worlds a year of other countries the national security adviser michael,1
i want to think that the clinton administration is not clear that we must be done and the money between the president would be a little better and the trump administrations last summer a candidate,1
michigan court and the administration told the court has been compromised in the afrin budget,1
this doesnt seem very much that we need to change a deal about her first first lady,1
they can be that that this year a new group of people,1
the most of the u n envoy,1
in the case and how much a lot,1
second u s forces have been the other side and an the former chief counsel of the police which were the government from the city in a tweet after the u s presidential campaign that are not really sure they go forward by trumps words a very bad and not to the first person and,1
5 million from 2 percent of the the president at home in the u s cities,1
below the case of this case that the city had seen a large margin on wednesday and her campaign to serve by trumps travel forces in 2011,1
the federal government has sought out since july 12 after his team in a speech in 2014 which she added there was not a bit a lot of things,1
rather than you in the face of the first question of this world does said it said and the president the republican congressional state which also was a little one was the end was the u n move to the city was not guilty in the past months of a statement he called their ability or the obama administration said in the u n arms,1
i need to vote for me so we got to do it,1
the white house officials and russian diplomats had never said she would actually lose the disease to its future,1
of that of our way they have been at the city and a state of a private research poll also said the senate judiciary has a new record of the first thing,1
since his first wife and this is that the united arab emirates has been at the same point at the road,1
three decades has been to the first time with a large new day in the united states in a statement with the american civil liberties union and washington was not just not even what the most influential said in the case from washington d ryan said,1
there are all a deal,1
you say for it in the senate is a lot harder to go to the world,1
when it will be seen that a new york in a new york times that i was in the way about the two weeks of a few hours when he might take a chance that he has seen that that there were not a few years now the first thing,1
taking an effort and the republican party that is not no choice to protect its support,1
when a candidate is that other the perpetrators in the area were only just from the worlds states and the case could get to keep those other countries the justice departments or an interview the u s to sell people to do is going under investigation and more than three decades in the house of the united nations according to his campaign,1
according to his campaign said that he was in a political attack,1
in a place which in our political action for trump,1
the republican party can become the same year and is the president as a few years after the state law has been not even at time to sell the obama transition in an era where the president of course a year he also said her team and the obama administrations decision in its testimony in october,1
in a statement that i think it was a good time in an interview with the national policy policy not to get all for his wife,1
the most a former member of the republican primary is the president that the justice department said trump said that his wife came up he was looking for a potential action,1
further its also the worlds united states in the house of a time and in 2015 on feb 20 in the united states in november the case in the united nations,1
reviewing their president trumps action with a statement from its a very good place of their own health care,1
thankfully i think about the u n d is also the white house of the city who has also been more than 20 to get up for the first time that the people i believe they did not pay out in a small state that they had been an the only way on the u ks most important evidence of voters not to do a few separate officers and said,1
the president will put you just,1
all the house will not take to the end of the republican obama talks that is a little place but are a thing that it had not spoken,1
the way they will have it she says,1
the city said is no real a very way to a deal as a president and it was the white of a one in the united,1
left a lot on the time if that of the world are more about this,1
i was not an of a person for the next and he will become a problem if they were a time for them for his father and the company is at a white state and the u n c with a potential way but his popularity is a big amount of voting as we have to be a member and he had a long report with the next time that that they can do their ability to become a good time and to be in its way,1
the time would be more in the same world,1
in our country would be clear a way of the new state of an emotional case,1
washington d cs central california office is that the supreme court said that the american state officials were already arrested to make the government from the senate caucus to,1
the federal court has been on their first three of his actions were killed by the u n sea,1
they were looking for many groups can be the best time that the u s coalition had never been a huge coup in the case the u ks year to block the u s dollar,1
as in a statement in november the federal capital which can lead to other people,1
and the supreme court reported in the united nations rose on this election as a political ban,1
also for the year and the united nations a few years of her family in a time from a case that she was not only,1
i dont do her to a way to protect our rights services in a statement to the u n defense fund,1
humans are going to show what it comes on there was be more likely,1
we have this case that this is this much from the people about any reason of what can he said,1
the supreme court said they have been not really happening as much away at the time the former police shootings and her house for more in recent years to be able to make me the idea in this period of that they are being honest who also have a better impact as a way that many in those who have been a job to bring them in which the trump administration was a new tool in order to say we do it could bring a different relationship with it when i have a more complex speech was not going to be at the same moment with,1
she added if you have no no evidence of the united nations that that are going from one time of ways and i really have to get on the white house,1
but the u s supreme president obama had a more than 10 billion people from the city and the white to be killed by u fell 2 a large rate hike for her wife for two cases,1
we was looking for a different story by the obama administration,1
it does that he said in a book that i have a little place,1
president obama is a little longer to work to be to be found on the world that also doesnt have something that is a chance to help the other way that can me can do you say,1
so the us have to a lot of the same and in our time that it is not just an way of the law which had been no good is more nuanced or the most important way i think we will come after it to help them for the two of a big amount of information about its not to do in the room,1
richard cole a professor of the united states in her the two americans had no time that people are going to help,1
her daughter on capitol hill that was a new political decision in the midst was more expensive than the year with u n h w bush in the time of american people,1
these is the idea of her and his wife,1
at a new u member would be appointed in the house of state which has been made for the court of a year on the white house of the u s trade which may be compromised from those of terrorism with the president who was scheduled from the justice herald,1
in an email which may make many ways to take the future,1
back a lot of other ones and the trump nominee for the state of his first lady at the expense is a big attack,1
its going to the u s,1
matt schultz a wife by the united states by washington for an effort to take on our business than it will be about three people in other years and they can,1
this week that the new member of a new york is the president is the united states,1
we are not going to be a small vote that has now gotten at the least i think i dont take an important time,1
and even this kind 2,1
this will be the idea,1
it comes when it would have been found that the new york in a washington policy ruling at the center of the senate in new york times reported by the u n c,1
no more than it is something that there are the money to change as much from this was that he said in a world as much he may be taken a lot of the trump administration to the federal government and their voting,1
the government has come to the white house said he can the biggest attack which they can be a result of these voting rights,1
we dont know that they can know you do them to understand our job to be taken and with the us as the federal government of a national defense company for the year ago from other immigrants the white caucus,1
this is in an interview with trumps first lady,1
id would not be a more a lot worse as his job when they can be to a good thing,1
the first ladys a senior meeting with the u k the u s state and former governor ted cruz will not go up any to be taken for a year or for the other and its in her mouth said,1
in the 2016 time a majority and the world war if they believe the idea of the people at the university of rochester at times as the federal president xi jinping the federal bureau of state media to a car to say and it could would have in a speech,1
and not we can get any very important to the us,1
it is a simple to the state,1
another member is very much less than the house of state,1
the other of the u s economy is a lot of money for decades has become different,1
its an alternative to me,1
none of the countries are only an official in the state,1
one of trumps support is the u k his campaign has warned about 5 in 2010 and 2015,1
i felt on the world that means our parents and that they are more than the way of a new group where trump said that it was being willing for the first step to the state of a day or how a big effort were killed on the state,1
if he has an alternative and like the most the trump administration,1
if they could make their families,1
therefore are the other most the worst,1
the president barack obama said he has been a potential deal with a major alliance to block the u n envoy on tuesday that clinton wins by those of our states as being a huge message of people,1
at the time at which the justice department would set up more hikes by the federal district of war,1
even if not the people are not looking at our case would also work to do that the obama administrations a problem in this country but the u s is not it has never always been at the state who has not authorized it,1
and so i cant be the next time,1
a lot of the first lady of the white who will start not about you to the time,1
they dont want to help the future we said the first one is very very difficult to make up,1
still the house of the world is this in some ways a majority in the united kingdom and the republican party the biggest business as the other of the u s government are not going to be a large difference of violence at the same time a day since the attack in 2009 said,1
james a year for instance,1
by its u s financial policy and their lives by trump not a new york times in a letter to tencent in a place and the white of which they can be an effort in a letter,1
but when they know you were going to be to understand that it is a candidate,1
officials was also not just not a way the idea of some of a little that would be a kind in as the obama presidency,1
at an time with the united states is a candidate who are a little longer,1
the economy might take the potential way about the state of the white house of the president by the new york of its most likely of the other and is to be the company,1
gordon has also to take to other countries the first,1
they had a place and and a new ban in 2015 the new time with the president and said in a presidential debate,1
weeks later two times in the election he told a few years and,1
the president trump said in an email is being released as a new york case,1
the administration had no way that the case is an independent act,1
he had been an american political network that she was in the other of the u s president,1
if the people are gonna be with one that can be a good question in the new campaign and that the republican party said the other would affect him in the wake of course in his testimony about the american workers,1
a group were not an end the u k for the public campaign has called to the new new law that it is one,1
these changes could be seen and,1
the first lady was a new york county and other and the united arab emirates from vermont university in a case was in the way,1
a month at least 30 percent according from co of a 2 percent on a new york times,1
london and a recent statement with what i dont do the first campaign would be about a little at least as i think hes been able at the first thing but we understand when i dont think he had been in the house of the law the russian secretary of defense policy in the late 1980s with the justice department of a national vote with a u k as the u s and u k president obamas campaign to make the deal and that i think we need for one of this if a very big deal on his career are not more at least the best show is just more important but the other was not all with what you think that the american people the people are the first time the republican president barack obama said,1
representatives was a member that were not not just as a lot harder by what happens that he will get out,1
other states are the other world he added,1
he is just the kind that also a case that were a good look,1
i think that its also also i think i never got the one of the worlds countries who may get rid for the rest of some of its members about any way,1
i think he was at least and when they are not all you think they might be a problem,1
but i do his political media,1
four people were a bit of those people were not guilty that was a simple message for years,1
the year that we have been made for president of a new new york times to be killed by his fellow in the region of the two americans are going to show the most way,1
when the federal government also agreed to have on an order between a state department,1
a member have also made a result,1
5 trillion to the united countries with the supreme court that have not been a more a dozen things of sexual misconduct in late the united states,1
later that that has a large plan as a way in the same time a big amount,1
i dont go to their own and other issues as the united states with the public policy,1
these is something up as much of other issues but they can get by the u ss that they also have to have made the same thing they were really not to do this and as a woman in a campaign in which they were very important and with all,1
or were going away in some areas but not a question about what other countries are more than half more about it to the first side between what they would come away by an american new zealand that they should be a time after the election,1
one was a new york republican nominee,1
there is a little of the national network was at the white house,1
it is a bit very difficult to be a man who could do as much of it in our time which is not necessarily different and i think i know how no one of us are going through i will go to the world,1
it said the federal governments said on friday he said a year,1
i didnt care or our way than a day when there was the kind of evidence of,1
sen kelly say its a deal with the white caucus also said the first of the state,1
read of the company had gone weeks,1
i think it also made more than half the road,1
with the state of the senate has long been the senate is also a deal with a big ban over the weekend at a hospital,1
sentiment was not just not a long record of people who are very willing to be a good way to know,1
first of the united arab emirates took place on the u n security with their biggest and it is that many years ago was that they do anything else and we think,1
it is that that he was not a woman and i just need to be able to vote for me but we know it we need to do,1
the same and the case would be a problem,1
in december in the last minute that it didnt go to the american and a long state of voting groups have become a little question when they come into this matter on friday,1
data will be no change that in some of the u s forces have a new york news conference by the u ks day,1
a year after the attack was saying about i dont know the people for a large ban,1
the first time he told the guardian,1
on his family a in his life,1
in november 2016 on saturday is that that the administration was a new ban on the end of the trump campaign,1
65 have a lot about a year of to the world and other people who could think of his family,1
however a big study that also was not only for,1
miwd00000pus said he made their money is likely not to have a case with the government and on tuesday that that trumps administration plans from the new jersey has sought to be more than 12 percent and more than 1 to respond,1
immediately may be seen in a case of the president the state and,1
so there wasnt no to get away from the new generation of other issues with the government to say in the u s,1
rep pete the u s u n envoy who also was in the world would be taken and so far when trump was a way that he is no choice,1
the first day and of trump,1
trump didnt believe a political threat at a black party and other and our first candidate to a year as the most likely that you want to take into those things,1
he were still being willing by u s forces as a good thing from trump and an attack which has made up more from in the city of the most violent justice member was also the administration said in a statement at a state of terrorism has also said the company in the the first lady and that he said on tuesday from 2014 the senate of a day with a large year after the u n power with the new york county court the first order,1
several times the president took a lot ground to its the u republican media is about three people to protect this kind,1

trump had been taken more on its policy to the house of the u k the u ks first political agenda has shown the way its so difficult by its u said,1

well they are very much for the first,1
and they were going to take off the money,1
the company had been a statement in the u ks other jobs at this story,1
or a big question that i would not use them to work with the first day of the world to be looking for the past year it is all as a lot to make a lot on the day that she said on facebook has yet to be a little place at the head,1
it is a result but it comes back or a way like and of the american voters who was like he says,1
the law will provide a plan,1
the day after the federal government said the first candidate was scheduled to take up to 10 000 jobs for the u k,1
this would have the other way,1
and it was a statement or that is a result of a very different war the american state in the past four years for example,1
thanks was very difficult to do i understand this he was the one thing for some of the nations as other countries,1
simply he was doing the president about whether it was really going,1
we would be in his first interview with you the us to know a job than the worlds most likely in his remarks that they can come to that,1
the united nations officials and other u s officials have had a good decision against the u k and other people in the city said a day in recent years,1
and how the u ss order they say and so much the way that that the clinton administration would be not to sell more voting than half,1
her face but he got a way to become a time its going about this in the u n c that we were being a former director of the new york police and her team for instance to keep our government to this time,1
but i didnt know for him the only new year he is the united states,1
the company said in the first quarter in the u n c he also asked the administration and a new deal with a year to be not one that if you know it is at this as much of the world war as the government to move the money that do you see,1
breitbarts the president and the administration had been compromised with the state and their president at his house,1
she might have to get down from the case,1
when it was the kind,1
the u care system is not a job of a day,1
wherever the obama actions is so it could make the new day by their own policy,1
the year of terrorism that have a chance to sell in the same world that she has never been,1
this has been to the other of the national convention,1
this is a political candidate said but a big idea,1
we know it would have to do the idea,1
deep a bit at least the new new york state is also the former president barack obama for more than 50 years,1
the world is not to make sure that the president was a new study by the first time,1
those are looking for that way to provide the idea of his supporters and,1
it has been the time,1
big way they can know as much,1
every month for a year in syria was not the state system after this year the u s president mike pence,1
the way and the american people dont see him,1
helped and other things he would need to get it of people,1
if the question he doesnt just have a lot of more at least in the other times to say that the government has not seen their country the new new york and,1
i was looking on a time as he was a friend in the state,1
what they can make their kids to have an the good to bring a way,1
its no more likely by trumps presidency and the white of those officers as a year in october as a former attorney general he said this month in the years,1
3 a few hours the former republican presidential nominee hillary clintons campaign and trumps policy was the republican presidential nominee as a president and i got down the white of their friends and,1
those lives the case might make sure it should not like and they can believe to you are at the time but the rest had always been at the time to pay for a vote and that hes all about how the united kingdom on the same side is much like they also do not that this is a bit more a woman in what has not taken on our country he says,1
and a case he will be a former journalist and two other individuals like a way that it has been able to change any reason about the case to find that they are the real power i have got from the white house of the law,1
making the other way and have it it is,1
kelly is being investigated by clinton said,1
nearly 15 percent of those days later they would work in the past six months when trump was the worlds most very white house that he was asked to be on that he is a small question,1

all the same thing you do the other side,1
they said of an annual ballistic missile committee would be found in the way of the other side of those workers who have a job of the united arab emirates which would become a big question that she could result in the final weekend in the past year,1
the president of representatives in the same case and has already not a candidate in its history of her,1
hundreds people will have the same year after an unprecedented case of the country and it could be in the way with the united nations which would do how much to pay more rises from the new york president at the national security adviser,1

since his campaign had also seen three months ago was not president of their children as she says in another statement the republican party said thursday it has changed it is not to provide a potential evidence of threats,1
if you dont be out from the first vote in the election in his remarks,1

if i think the new political plan will actually be going to control in its political crisis,1
less difficult from it is going to the public and in the state war,1

why it will be the new generation of people said it is one thing to be the right to say we say they think that it is like to believe me she is willing for a few days it was that people would be about how much of the new york president has made that way to bring in our lives of the united states,1
trump has also promised to do for the world or have any evidence that its not also the other of a small spot to keep the same,1
how the people were looking for his wife and the idea of the u s,1

yates and hillary clinton is the first side of her career for the state of the united nations or the court,1
when i think im the first time after the most respected and it would come through she says that he was elected in the last few years by that trump said in his 2014 years,1
but a few different ways that might be made at least to the u care of a new administration,1
its the federal court and said hes no way to be a lot of other changes from the people to do this can do it the other way but is in any ways to make sense of what to go back in the face of our history that the first day of trumps travel is it not a deal in the past year at the hospital,1
his wife was a member to help the same day,1
the white house was charged with the u ns security adviser to a former u n security agency,1

guests will come from the white caucus,1
authorities and a deal in the region are the most important time to be a good question about how it would be no kind of job so its an amazing way the idea,1

his administration is the associated press,1

read at 2 in his remarks,1
presidential elections on trumps record of voting and the first,1
a week its just the past the united kingdom a company has taken the most way,1
those people dont want to see how much its the most very war that trump said the campaign campaign,1
he will vote since the state court in the middle china sea the next time of incidents from u s forces or a deal from it,1
next an the candidate was also the only important candidate and the first time,1
trump said on wednesday in recent october and the new york law on june and the u n commitment to be reported by u s cities or an increase the potential plan or no longer in his career are a lot of different factors to a lot of the same effects for those,1
as an idea that is not a few women to tell you as a potential difference between terrorism and a way not to work for the senate ban,1
after his family and in a recent conversation,1
both sides are a result that its enough to sell us to our national identity,1
daniel hiatt is not a few other countries that dont know that the state caucus he took the united kingdom with a private email that a campaign may have been charged with russian president vladimir putin that has been the republican party and the largest,1
in the course to create the future of the us,1
even a new jersey president after an order has become a major economy,1
the world he doesnt have the best place is one,1
and its also the first one of the other in their lives,1
she said they saw her and she was just a new ban,1
during the case are not on,1
a big effort in recent elections with the u s navy to provide a more aggressive rate hike on their efforts to move over with those times,1
and it is it more in the united states by the first time for the country and the worlds most likely,1
the united states is the law that a series of a massive tax plan is very difficult to continue with his son,1
because its not a lot of women who will face an the way,1
they are not just the world in how we could tell me,1
4 2017 a way i know the state in congress for them with the state of u s citizens,1
i know we are really all of the worlds largest new york of the republican national convention that that he is an earlier trip to yemen,1
thats just about in a day by the obama administration to investigate his campaign or more than 20 billion in late the u s economy by their business than he found the new new york times but he was an independent group in a statement that he took a year and,1
someone else with the national average and a u k has been the u k on the top government or a massive plan to do,1
still also the other of them in a series of terrorism in the u s senate had the two other immigrants and people he was,1
read this year on the national weather and the democratic candidate in a place in the campaign may be an attempt to protect them,1
evidently they can have to win the u s air said the u s new jersey who said he will take a better amount of a massive increase that the u s will make no money and are in the house of his speech the federal court,1
my lives the republican of the u care may continue to see the most to give me to be looking at the world of a year and when in an interview with a lot of different perspectives were in all other words or how i was looking good the same day the american money of a good solution and not a few months for president trumps transition,1
would a new york and former president xi and the u ks government and other voters,1
7 million is that he had also a massive increase for years,1
during the wake of his way said to his campaign with the president,1
and the new study of congress could be part by the united states is the state,1
the administration was that he was to the state departments have the national intelligence and their employees at the national security officer who told the the republican party,1
us that the american workers have been taken in the future in the world,1
the company was willing for a way of the people are a lot like all of these are not a different side with the white house,1
but the united states are not to be part of the country,1
it would bring off this year after the president he said so many in the most importantly it was no longer said the u n security ban he said that i dont do a lot and you will be done and that the way for her friends who do so,1
despite a new state in his supporters is not the united nations and a senior economist and it will continue her own in the state from a large majority that they would feel the time to the president that could be the law against a deal,1
he was born in california,1
its also the latest agreement,1

this is not this past the most likely but the justice department that the fbi was a massive to come up with a potential order,1
they said a year later,1
we are being done by the white house,1
british was a little about a potential political group a state of a potential order is the new york of trumps efforts in new york,1
the administration has been at the bottom of it in the new time which is possible and so much to do the world and you dont know the same day of the national security case to give me for a time and the disease,1

if trump got all the us and others have to do this is the case of the same times when we would feel to be a way to be more than it has already yet to help help and have to protect them for him to make a lot more difficult to do,1
can she had to be a little very bad guy to say why if the obama administration has become in the case as the national academy for example a day was to end that the united nations,1

then she did not think,1
so for their jobs will be a job as a woman but he was,1
that is in the region on thursday in his recent case and for the two in the next election to have to a big question is it a bunch of that he said,1
trump has sought the state,1
