the subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at smart people and average joes like the protagonists,0
who wants to see teenager kay lenz being brutally raped,0
warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well,0

i mean it does n't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects lots of blood and gore some scary moments and a decent plot,0
armstrong get themselves outrageously madeup to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham you 've got to love this film,0
yes it really is that bad,0
keep an open mind about actors and budget and you will have a good time,0
well now i'm sure i 've uncovered an earlier example of this bizarre phenomenon,0
some sections are a little tough here and there but overall you can beat this game,0
he tries his best with father conroy and his best moments are musical ones especially with debbie reynolds but the story is not convincing,0
but then again i 've watched howling vii about five times now so maybe you really should n't be listening to me,0
perhaps the most painful point of the movie was the subplot about the ghost confederate soldiers that seem to be of little to no help to the story,0
the scene in which moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with curly in dutiful but dumb,0
and novel animation touches appear right up to the end,0
save your time if not money and give this movie a pass,0
there 's lots of humor in the movie but no pulling back on the anger they feel,0
i like jeff daniels but he should stick to acting and forget writing,0
unfortunately for me i had to sit through the whole thing as i had started it and it was too hot and windy to go outside,0
the only reason why i watched it was because of christina lindberg,0
it evolves around a very cool and handy system where it 's very easy to get accompanied by people in younger ages due to the very basic system of the game which is actually great,0

that is until a few people turn up dead,0
crawford and lionel barrymore not only make their clichd lines and characters wholly believable they literally walk off into the sunrise together at the end as clichs often do,0
there should be no compromise because that child is in the world because of your choice,0
this experimental silent film made in switzerland by an independent british film company is chiefly remembered as paul robeson 's first film,0
both aykroyd and chase have been better and both have had better material to work with i'm sure,0
if one is not familiar with the original plot i assure you this is not a bad film for you to see but if you ever wish to see the original or are as i am a diehard fan of the classic play you would do best to avoid the film altogether,0
the thing that makes the film rise above the mediocre to me is its stunning visual and aural beauty,0
like a lot of those 1950s pictures written on the wind was shot entirely in a studio lot,0
a dozen quirky characters come and go most prominently keenan wynn as douglas 's friend who does nothing but make wry comments,0
so what 's so special,0
a movie which has for several times dialogs just like i will pass there later ok,0
one must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film they are alist and willing participants to something that let 's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation,0
the character development and witty script allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and be amused,0

the average american just has a hard time to understand that getting rid of a few bags of trash may become an almost insurmountable problem that finding new friends among your neighbors or colleagues at work can be so difficult,0

the story begins when her sappy cousin arrives at eva 's mansion and boy is she in for one wild ride,0
this movie reminds me of ed wood 's plan 9 from outer space,0
transparent acting distanced me from the movie as well as bad camerawork and things that just make you go wow that 's incredibly cheesy,0
i think there are many fine actresses that could have played hunter 's role and because of her antiamerican positions i think the role should have been given to someone else,0
it 's a pity that smart approaches to horror from hollywood such as the academy seem to have mostly died off with rod serling,0
overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic,0
it was cheesy and fun,0
richard gere and claire danes pair up ala david duchovny and gillian anderson only that they do n't belong to any federal investigative agency who bear arms but are employees of protective services who 's chief role is to ensure that sexual predators who belong to their jurisdiction are kept safe from society when they are released from having served time,0
from beginning to end dumb dumber is sheer hilarity,0
the homes they return to with grown children and independent working women along with a depressed economy only add to the strife,0
instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack,0
if you enjoy actionoriented period films and you are n't bothered by inaccurate historical accounts you may enjoy this film,0
in high school nobody wants to go to the prom with you,0
there 's a lot of lines like that but not funny just out of context,0
having little kids call each other sexual names and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier,0

the producers had thought about casting marlon brando in the title role but sinatra beat brando to the punch,0
the singing from owl jolson and the rest of the music in this short is very good another thing that makes this short worth watching,0
one of the messages i got from it was that maybe all failures and accidents are not fatal after all,0
there is more atmosphere at the local giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons,0
a horror movie that is fourth in a series should be terrible,0
the similarities do not end there there are even a couple of those cgi zooms into wounds accompanied by a metallic sound,0
also jay o sanders and dermot mulroney,0
i can only imagine that he was jumping on the youth bandwagon and thus cast some of the names of the moment but he would have done better had he gone with unknowns who are actually gifted,0
she warps the movie from a very funny comedy into just another joan crawford tragedy of sorts,0
it is also an r rated movie so it 's not entirely wholesome,0
this guy acted on his despair,0
this is a candidate for worst films i 've ever seen,0
i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies but this movie is bad,0
the man pulling the rope to halt its ascent is helped by joe and other three men that appear on the scene almost simultaneously without we having seen anyone around,0
i do n't know what they were smoking,0
as i indicated the plot never drew me in,0
for some of the names in the cast i 'd expect a much better movie,0
both swayze and de la pena were wonderful dancers in their prime but to be only 7 years away from professional dancing as stated in this film is frankly a bit ridiculous when it is obviously many more years than that more like 20 there is certainly a lot of pain in a dancer 's life from growing older and no longer being capable of dancing the way you once could,0
one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool,0
i ca n't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it especially when they said it was dangerous to go there,0
so it is very hard to root for someone this selfinvolved,0
like those other movies this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside and run down the hallways a lot while they get picked off one by one,0

for whatever reason our killer only goes after females,0
indeed there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan,0
only question is if sam gets killed then how does his family 's line continue,0
it 's fresh funny and amazingly clever,0
in the meantime a close relationship develops between the bodyguard and the singer,0
easily one of my three or four favorite films,0
i suppose if you were a huge shawshank fan you might get something out of this but for casual viewers it 's just one big mess,0
the fact that shahrukh not sunny captivated the audience 's attention proves that everyone has that helpless inner drive to pursue something that 's not really in their hands,0
this one however is n't that bad nor is the message that convoluted and the film of the victims is n't as grotesque as some similar films,0
the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house,0
at first she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her,0
sadly they were right the first hour actually had me i was like are they crazy,0

well i heard about it then i found the trailer,0
apparently bukowski 's work is based in the la area and this has been translated to european locations but works quite well,0

so does she copy the pages,0
scorsese has proved time and time again that he is probably the most talented director in hollywood and is n't going anywhere anytime soon,0
what kind of adventures will chong and red get into,0
all in all watchable for bogie who is always a master and certainly a story that will hold your interest,0
it was easy to decipher the true killer and his acting did n't help,0
this movie is a treasure and i thank god it has not been remade,0
and in the inglorious bastards he outdoes himself,0
all in all its a fun movie that gives you a little dose of love and laughter,0
this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960 's woodstock,0
and then when nikki walks out of the church with her baby he just stands there and walks away,0
to conclude this flick surpasses most of horror films produced nowadays,0
but this movie disappointed me,0
but actually she 's the highpoint of this little flick,0
where are the master tapes and all the unused footage,0
all of those were unforgettable original had good real good thoughts action women till the x files came and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact the catastrophe,0
typical white trash lives not compellingly told,0
kurt russell did a incredible job his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined,0
ask yourself could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric,0
he goes home and his roommate stan does not help stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument,0
i ca n't believe i wasted my time with this movie,0
the story is strange but well crafted and the bizarre imagery and atmosphere make this a painfully unique scary experience,0

the only film that i never wanted to be an end to,0
francis learned much about golf from reading vardon 's books on the subject and vardon is his idol all growing up,0
i felt the man who made this wanted to be understood,0
now if only someone had been filming those numbers,0
this movie is the worst movie of the year,0
or even some jokes about him being that english,0
i give it 3 out of 10 stars,0
nowhere do we see why it is that ken leung 's character is such a babe magnet,0
i rated this film an 810,0
everyone talks about how good life can be somewhere else in new york chicago the beaches of florida and the coast of mexico somewhere up the road apiece,0
the film is not about plot or about characters,0
this was truly one of the greatest shows ever to grace my television,0
i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here,0
the themes are carried forward with power and human dignity,0
the acting is n't always top notch but the thrills are good and the story 's good,0
though soon there obsession turns to murder and the doctor do n't seem to worry how they are getting their cadavers,0
this is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film does n't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting,0
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids,0
mix these unanswered questions with the uncomfortable hint of sexuality between york and minnelli and you have nearly 90 of this movie,0
i 'd love to see snipes work with somebody like isaac florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a dtv production and work with alpha stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there,0
do n't know why on earth they offer it to me,0
people you need to spend money to make money,0
but if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you,0
also the killers clues are a little obscure are n't they,0
i am sorry that some people cannot find the new artistic interpretations of the miss marple series refreshing,0
also there is an appearance by codirector jeff as he is in all his films,0
he too is told of the many opportunities to escape but steadfastly follows orders right up to his execution by firing squad,0
the only part i thought was unnecessary was the relationship between hilary and patrick dempsey,0
if dani made this as a comedy then good going him,0
and by that i mean that americans of all races simply do not want to deal with the subject much,0
if you ca n't find the mst3k version avoid this at all costs,0
the film captures and interprets his artistic method his inspiration and his struggles to accept a harsh reality in the face of his idealist imagination,0
audie murphy was a goodlooking man and the most legitimate of decorated war heroes,0
and so it goes clich after clich is piling up and this is why the movie does not work,0
the sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful,0
nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to vonnegut 's depiction of a man who has lost all for love,0
the previous user comment mentioned it 's a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80 's movie and most of all it 's a jonathan demme movie,0
a few good moments but does little to educate and little to really entertain,0
if you have n't seen this film already watch it,0
it 's when the boys are seated around the dinner table and being coached on proper dining etiquette but only pretending to use utensils and eat food,0
i can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this crap,0
adrian monk is a former police officer with obsessive compulsive disorder and a fear of filth,0
someone should have taken the first twenty pages of this script developed the plot from there are thrown the rest of it on the fire,0
i watched the entire film but i 'd suggest that you do n't,0
mpaa rated for violencegore language sexuality nudity and some drug content,0
i did enjoy hearing macho man by the village people over the closing credits,0
the acting is great but you have to understand the parts to notice that,0
an entertaining film about holmes going to the usa to recover an important diplomatic document,0
final verdict 1 out of 10,0
did seagal do his own fight scene,0
anyone can write jokes or funny dialog and have actors memorize them but the basis of this movie is improve,0
the problem with this film is that its lacking in what made the first 2 films popular,0
into a happy household comes the gypsy girl played by myrna loy,0
are we living in the same planet here,0
a lot of comments have been written noting its supposed surrealism and metaphor,0
it has weak hammy acting and the devil comes in these ridiculous guises like a bubbly sweet schoolgirl,0
seriously stay away from it,0
in short he 's what more actors should be like,0
and joan plowright is actually quite funny,0
this scene is perfect in it 's simplicity,0
it was headacheinducing fare to be sure,0
as a fan of the extreme japanese cinema i was really excited to finally get my hands on this film,0
if you 've only seen hollywood movies then you might think that this is art but otherwise your in for a dud,0
it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut 's book and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic,0
there are various reasons for this,0
i did n't however mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious setup and part of the overall camp of the movie,0
certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for,0
moreso this is one of those foreign language films that presents its lead character as a cripple whom can do nothing but talk to the people around him and yet is able to come across as engaging and compelling anyway,0
7 yes yes she 's in heaven running around in a field,0
the acting is exceptional and never goes over the top,0
as a lush love story it 's pretty good,0
many talented filmmakers got their start directing commercials or music videos,0
the film had no blatant plot,0
she 's so elegant his character is so country bumpkin,0
shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla,0
i know it was supposed to be shocking but i just thought the whole thing was incredibly silly,0
i remember when skateboarding had it 's rebirth in the 70s,0
there is a lot to talk about but all i would say is that you need to watch it,0

the father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife,0
without actually spoiling the storyline i must admit that after seeing ac we have been putting pieces together with my friends relying on our knowledge of ffvii,0

he should have been fascinating but he was n't in this movie,0
ok not exactly the same thing but i think you people get my point,0
please advise on current status of this good film,0
what 's so bad about this film,0
during this film the viewer gets to enjoy the work of three excellent actors,0
he is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress,0
unfortunately that means that most of the jokes are extremely low and juvenile,0
i was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was,0
more importantly is the idea of presentation and the experience requires elegance and an amazing contrast of color,0
i had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it a bit disappointed,0
i do n't think i even have to explain what would be wrong with that picture,0
he 's very good in an easy role,0
this film story initially appeared to be a more or less typical coming of age story of a teenage girl set in the '50 's at the height of the atomic bomb testing age in the desert southwest but ended up being a sad and multifaceted story of unrealized potential chronic physical pain alcoholism paranoia abuse spousal enabling ruined family potential and of a daughter 's loss of love and trust in her father due to the results of his very human and typical response to great pain self medication by alcohol,0
i have n't felt such pity frustration empathy and genuine identification with the protagonist in a long time,0
furthermore angelopoulos' treatment of history in the weeping meadow is certainly different from that in the travelling players,0
also to be noted is some exceptional cinematography combined with great special effects,0
this looks worse than a made for tv,0
and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys,0
first of all the acting in the movie was absolutely terribly except for one minute part in the movie where washington dies she was the only person who showed emotion when she actually died,0
but these days spending what would appear to be about 30000 tops on making a movie to witness to people with is just pathetic,0
i'm no censor but i know for a fact that cleavage does not belong in a kids movie,0
he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wall,0
thus a war is started leading to military coups and elaborate diplomatic situations,0
mclaglen 's large simple character just wants to go to america and we 're reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently,0
there are shots of the bad guys walking across the parking lot and then they appear in the hospital hallway,0

nothing is a fantastic film full of laughs and above all imagination,0
while i was familiar with his better known compositions i learned about this man 's brilliant writing and beautiful singing,0

the grand duke is a very cool chap and funny too,0
no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous videotaped nonsense what was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters,0

i was hoping for a lot better after seeing high school musical,0

to the filmmakers' credit the excellent criterion dvd release includes outtakes and bonus material that partially redeem the main film behind the scenes photographs interviews and commentary filling in some of the blank spots the original editing consciously decided to omit in its drive for unadulterated horror and depression,0
it pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the black forest,0
this is mainly due to its poorly executed characters and uninteresting actors,0
james garner as the commander and leonard nimoy as the king give impressive performances,0
this is probably one of my favorite english import movies in the new millennium,0
the film has other faults as well,0
and then inexplicable implausible love,0
the moments with these people are magical showing primarily the soft interior of most of the women who know precisely what they are doing and why there are messages of survival and true courage as well as libidinous abandonment,0
merkerson did a good job but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway,0
the movie has two brief jokes revolving around racial stereotypes,0
after the singing and dancing is over it 's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work,0
and almost all the transitions between scenes are these great closeups of the psycho in the er scrubs,0
it hits the social political and human points of the issue accurately,0
as usual the performances are excellent,0
i wo n't even get into the camerawork just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes most of the shots are not framed correctly at all and the movie just seems made by amateurs,0
the simpsons road rage is a quite good game,0
this is not how it works in this country,0

it follows a heavy metal fan as he makes his journey to discover more about the culture and reception of his favourite genre,0
furthermore what makes it a great drama is the strong cast and the characters that they play,0

i had the good fortune of being able to see this gem at a public screening this week,0
it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest,0
i ca n't understand why anyone who truly like the novel emma could like it unless it miraculously redeems itself after the point i switched it off,0
it 's fresh genuine and filmed in a nonamerican way mostly as far as its framing and editing are concerned,0
what of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other it is all enjoyable leaving a smile on your face,0
how do films like this get made,0
with a supposed budget of about 500000 this was a low budget film it show 's i just hate films generally that look like they were shot on a camcorder with no real visual aesthetics or competence,0
if you get the chance to see this show cancel everything and tape it you wo n't be disappointed,0
hollywood did something right for a change,0
the ibm corporation is founded,0
the scriptwriters directors and actors have lost sight of the cornerstone of a good story the concept of suspension of disbelief,0
great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas,0
that would have been something to turn this into a battle of wits between two fiercely competitive and charming men,0
i can only guess what was edited out,0
he might be speaking for the audience why make this movie,0
not so with simon says,0
the ending still haunts me to this day,0
he looked like an escapee from a broadway musical,0
and i can also make allowances for the ahem acting and fight choreography,0
i 'd pay 20 bucks for it and i'm cheap,0
why do it unless you had a lot of screen time to fill,0
like i said this movie is every little boys dream the movie contains a terrific setting big muscled barbarians beautiful topless women big bad monsters and jokes you 'll only get when you get older,0
however once you get past the impressive first five minutes the film falls completely flat,0
if you have n't seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out,0
although some of the kids are genuinely talented that is really beside the point,0
otherwise it 's one to avoid,0
a happy ending had n't spoiled the story would it,0
remember when mel brooks used to be funny,0
his camera focuses on beery for long takes allowing the actor to potter about doing his little bits of business and developing the character,0
i really enjoyed bee movie,0
climbing a mountain with a backpack full of rocks would be more enjoyable than sitting through this movie,0
nice to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change,0
still the premise was strong enough that i hung on to the end just to see how the plot would resolve itself and the alien 's motives were sufficiently ambiguous at first that i could sort of think of it as an enigma,0
there 's an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who 's also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward,0
it is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today,0

steven bauer shines as tony 's friend manny,0
unless you personally know the filmmakers and are curious what they were up to that one summer stay away,0

it is a huge waste of time and money,0
i ca n't tell you how many times when i hear a noise at my house i grab the fire poker and it was a nice touch for her to do the same even though she idiotically forgets it when she needs it most,0
at least it was restricted to a digital channel so the majority of people would have avoided watching it,0
if you were to make a modernday mary poppins at least make it a decent movie,0

the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find peter o'toole entertaining,0
mr bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others,0
and if you are n't a fan of this type of comedy then why are you reading this anyways,0

buster keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies,0

a hodge podge of gore nudity black gloved killers voodoo satanism surrealism and unintentional camp,0

the actors were perfectly cast,0
i wonder if any sport is filmed and is just surrounded by all this beauty in reallife too like horse racing,0
bottom line do n't bother with it,0
colin firth as mr darcy is perfect,0
some of the segments are funny original and interesting but others are so meaningless that it 's appalling,0

he was kind of the black sheep of the family handsome though,0
i imagine this misery was originally in black and white,0
the eye 2 is the sequel to the eye,0
although i may be just a little biased on the subject,0
this movie is more stupid than funny,0
the ending when tatiana finally learns for certain that boris is dead still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future,0
he does get to show off his beautiful voice but it is quickly and not very memorable,0
but much of this can be forgiven if the general intention with the movie is good or just honest,0
yet they 've transferred the fantasy from the book very well and that made it worth a look for me,0
is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in,0
hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us yankee rebel or otherwise who still believe in honor loyalty trust family and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing,0

the costumes for the time period did n't match very well,0
so here 's another one from al adamson who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about filmmaking since the blood of dracula 's castle days,0
i was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998 after both american history x and romper stomper,0
look they chat in chat rooms,0
the flashbacks now in season 1 and 2 which i think was exceptional the flashbacks were quite frequent and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny,0
the characters are pretty much nonexistent and we do n't care for any of them,0
the hills have eyes part ii was really pathetic and low not to mention beyond unbelievable,0

here we get to see another side of her loving working mom,0
a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot not manipulate and comment with snide captions,0
this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first 10 minutes,0
this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being,0
it 's painfully predictable and stupid and therefore nothing but boring,0
one thing was clear though it was supposed to be followed by a tv series,0
its story also is n't that interesting,0
rating 8 of 10 stars,0
a local scientist and his goofy assistant who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver 's brain into campbell 's damaged skull,0
the voice wears a cap bearing the state motto of new hampshire live free or die,0

a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent,0
as you may know the roman church takes a dim view of suicide and no good catholic much less a prince of the church would ever consider it,0
this was one of those clever movies that had a twist at the end,0
i 'd like to see it again,0
the question that 's it,0
the plot went on and on with no focus whatsoever,0
humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry,0
i saw this with a friend of mine over the weekend in a press screening and i really did not enjoy it,0
this movie was a huge waste of money,0
on another note i think you get a somewhat good glimpse of the 70s when you watch this show,0
be clever and enjoy the great cinema,0
it 's just another kid 's movie with no heart or faith in the audience,0
that was my experience with trick or treat,0
of course anna 's grandparents are grand bourgeois but they are not horrible persons,0
this movie to me is great because it shows the true ups and downs in marriage and friendships,0
this one was a stinker,0
the acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by philip glass,0

how do they make scarecrows scary,0
here i am talking of aditya chopra,0
there are some hilarious moments so downright comical it made me burst out laughing,0
my biggest complaint i 've stated,0
the ambitious script deserves some credit for the way it keeps intercutting the past with the present tense a technique that results in some intriguing effects in one scene we see somebody killed in the next scene there he is moving and talking,0
boy how i was being cheated with cheap knock offs,0
if you enjoyed it at all you have to see ghost world and american movie,0
it is mean spirited ugly and worse than a waste of film it is a bummer and a downer,0
it is so obviously not her voice and crawford 's overdone acting during it is just incredible,0
its is worth seeing for its visuals,0
anyway the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival,0
it was this place away from their regular lives that allowed them to see themselves and each other in a different light,0
i can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced to star in this worthless tv,0
but if you 're in the mood for some bad horror hijinks basilisk the serpent king will fit the bill,0
now with the 2005 film version having got the praise it did there will be people who prefer this version to the movie version and vice versa,0
it 's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this,0
but erkan and stefan had been just a little better in some of their standup programs,0
we were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character jo was n't on,0
another good score by hartley,0
again this is not hollywood it is korea and in korean cinema especially drama they pull no punches,0
kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself,0
the cover of the dvd is hilarious they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film,0
first i'm convinced that our kids are not stupids they are just kids but they know what 's nice or disgusting,0

antonioni is comparably wise to his movie,0
a great concept was ruined,0
this movie is a masterpiece,0
i did not notice a single black student or player in the school,0
it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were,0
i read somewhere that great stress can be a catalyst for producing great art,0
so says mishima anyway a young sheltered boy who becomes a celebrity author,0
i 'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class,0
yes it does and what a great moral to try to prove,0
there is nothing thrilling about it,0
but in the end the horrifying truth comes out and their lives are changed forever,0
amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie my friend dared me to watch btk,0
i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school,0
i do n't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest,0
unfortunately i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore,0
i love dan seymour 's acting he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in casablanca and many great pictures,0
the music was in my opinion the weakest link in this movie,0
go back and watch star wars again,0
as andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them i really did feel for him like i say because i would find it incredibly hard to live if i was like that,0
she was good in the sweet hereafter and very engaging in this movie,0
very unnecessary since it is obvious who is going to live from the start very lousy slasher flick,0
this sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what i heard about gigli that ben and jen flop earlier this summer,0
and with the dead we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema,0
great writing along with a spectacular cast make this character driven masterpiece worth investing time in,0
legacy is an odd mix of teen comedy murder mystery that just did n't do anything for me as it fails to deliver on either count as it does n't quite know what it wants to be to make matters even worse it 's irritating,0
why it was canceled after one season is a mystery to me but i definitely miss the characters,0
most of the time anyway,0
the music by danny elfman i find to be his career best,0
you have a insecure troubled and fascinating main character who is trapped between two women,0
in another the cops approach a boat filled with hoods and the hood immediately open fire,0
i only know one word she says si,0
if you took out the fart jokes the penis jokes and the irritable bowel jokes there would really only be about 10 minutes of film and those 10 minutes would be stuffed with every comic clich you could imagine,0
i could n't help but notice that cushing 's character keeps his suit and jacket on even though it suppose to be about 100 degrees,0
i 've taken another look at this film and still consider it pretty good,0
it 's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie,0
also i miss the true gadgets that gadget had and especially the gadget car,0
i'm surprised that this movie is n't considered dirty like lolita is,0
he used to be rebecka 's boyfriend and it 's obvious he still has feelings for her much to his wife bethany 's dismay,0

she plays jane brooks a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase,0
but i am astounded by the number of negative reviews that this film has received,0
some decisions are just beyond personal rights,0
the cast is one of the better assembled for any of these films,0
the zombie 's in this film must have been bitten by radioactive zombie spiders because they develop powers very similar to spiderman when they turn,0
hollywood north is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together despite a number of conflicting threads,0
there are n't exactly a lot of novel or singular moments that make it stand out other than the very unique character of duane barry but nevertheless i do enjoy watching it every time,0
do n't miss it if you have n't seen it yet,0
the cooks and caretakers totally put upon walk out,0
once again whereas the original movie was more realistic these last two are by far the most gory,0
the sheer silliness of the plot and the completely mismatched trio of friends make this a film to sit back with a beverage of your choice and laugh at,0
we are then supposed to sympathize with him which we do n't because we hate him,0
simple if it is n't of god it 's the of the devil stupid,0
maybe part of that was the horrible dialog,0
i will pay u 1 to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend,0
the five boys are orphaned barrie is made their guardian,0
the only reason i would ever recommend this film is so you can laugh at the hilariously outofplace scene involving the fat ethnic kid who can communicate with the dead when he rides in a fast car and blasts rap music loud enough,0
both lead parts were passed over by several actors,0
specifically regarding more threads and more developed threads,0
sadie and ben want to get married but reverend frank wants to put them thru some tests to see if they are really suited for each other,0

all i know is that it is boring and in my humble opinion a waste of celluloid and talent,0
why were n't the lessons with dumbledore fully developed,0
recommended in all languages with a good translation,0
she like the rest of them has a soul that is every bit as corrupt whereas carrie was a complete innocent,0
i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed,0
having read the comments on this title i must agree with those from the people in greece,0
in a nutshell his western shot blanks,0
one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left,0
why do we do this to ourselves anyway,0
they meet for lunch and light their cigarettes from the same match,0
mitchum gets to sing in rachel and the stranger and even cut a couple of records of the songs he sings from the film,0
it 's funny this movie had two subplots but not an actual plot to keep it going,0
in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this,0
or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the jewish state,0
and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he 's being missed at home,0
well i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend or a friend of a friend,0

it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off,0
everything from the acting to the camera work to the story itself is top notch and this is an example of a great film and that rare movie that myself and my film going friends can actually agree on,0
long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller that fails to have the hitchcockian thrills that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending bland deaths acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood and a decent soundtrack,0
lucas beauchamp is something of an anomaly in this small town,0
to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch,0

i had the strength to see it through but why,0
mr wilder is in my humble opinion one of the most original funny man during the 70s and 80s,0
it is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever,0
derrida the film on the other hand is an amateurish waste,0
sounds pretty sick is n't it,0
one might as well criticize the wizard of oz king kong the maltese falcon casablanca the black stallion or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life,0
although i would n't rate this as high as dracula 's daughter the film does have it 's moments,0
unfortunately there is nothing funny or intelligent or accurate or even worthwhile in this movie,0
a sick bleak atmosphere is created with the stark photography and minimal sounds but each scene goes on a bit too long and so does the film as a whole,0
there is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think,0
some of the action sequences are rather memorable and somewhat comedic,0
by some miracle the police trim the list down to bronson,0
in strange illusion at 51 his profile was still as sharp as a crease but his face was beginning to look its age,0

there are few zombie films that are very well good,0

the sound effects used in the movie for the komodo vary from a tiger to an elephant,0
no spoilers in this review,0
but the boxoffice failure of this film was undeserved and so is its continuing reputation as something of a failure for cagney 's career,0
on the shriek show dvd there is a lamberto bava interview in which he is careful to mention that this is not part of his classic demons series,0
the cast is mostly unknown to me at least with the exception of slater,0
these two later scenes would have needed little or no change had the long and totally unnecessary introductory sequence not been included and the film would then have opened logically by introducing its principal characters,0
but my goodness is it cheap,0
i had paid attention all along i was impressed with the film and thought the acting the cinematography and the direction were all superb,0
the special effects were secondrate at best with obvious seams visible and cgi clearly recognizable,0
he tried too hard playing for laughs probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his black books character would work here,0
the head explodes and i figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun,0
horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible,0
i have probably seen it with my daughter at least 6 times but i still laugh at sight gags and funny lines and continue to find it hilariously funny how sexy vanessa williams' character is especially for a preschool kid 's movie,0
rani mukherjee is much more beautiful in the chalte chalte yet gives a more charming performance here,0
i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily,0

i think this may be a comment on the song but it could reflect on the acting,0

5 years later the child is involved in a plane crash that killed his parents,0
the episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin,0
the greatest problem with the indie film movement is that everybody thinks they 're making great art,0
something that i find unusual in dickens',0
walter matthau is buttermaker the coach assigned to lead this motley crew of talentless kids,0
both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography,0
it is ridiculous that jesse is displayed as being smarter than any of the federal agents shown in this movie but it 's still funny in an unintentional away,0
they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters,0
if you have any recollection of 80s hard rock i think you 'd like this,0

so that the filmmakers do n't have to leave town but can use la locations for the shoot,0
some elements may be compared to terry gilliam 's twelve monkeys but i find miracle mile superior to it,0

elsie who overhears this is angered,0
zoom ahead to her discharge,0
one he is basically that old guy in horror movies that warns people not to go into the woods,0
that said this is probably a renter rather than a keeper but it should be on the must see list especially f you love old movies and movie history,0
wasnt worth the 14 dollars though,0
this is a film that reflects the end of the precode period with its straightforward approach to sex outside of marriage,0
the only reason i would give it a 1 is because of the murder scene in the woods and the broom stick scene,0
it reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again,0
the plot is ok fairly standard shake on a playful serial killer vs cop movie but the dialog is simply horrible,0
i did not find any of this amusing,0
it 's aimed at those of us who have been married or in a long term relationship,0

this production was a welldone piece of work,0
in agents secrets i could n't be bothered with the hero at all,0
so then my complaints really are minor and perhaps frivolous since this remains among my favorite shows on tv,0
did n't learn too much about any of the characters so it did n't matter if we lost one or two along the way,0
danger is not around every turn as these are rare occurrences,0
yes it 's another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canon,0
but while gump files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box four friends picks up and embraces each toy thus blurring the lines between what you hold dearly and what you are,0
the first half of the movie was pretty good,0
hunch as mentioned is unfunny and useless,0
pretty maggie grace might be the only draw for this film,0
i'm aware i 've gone on a bit of a tangent here but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel but the truth is it was n't even shot on film it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust,0
what takes place in this academy is little more than youngsters sat around dining tables or sat on rocks outside babbling nonsense and there are a few interactions with the creepy people who work there,0
if you 're an enormous fan of willis o'brien and his work then do watch this film as it contains some of the best integration of stopmotion animation and live action you 'll see in any film,0
ebert to the contrary this movie is a success,0
however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur,0
this movie offers nothing new,0
however nat unfortunately never realized it 's often his own perception that can turn against him,0
though various sources have suggested different names film historians have generally agreed that the following casting decisions are likely ned kelly dan kelly steve hart and joe byrne,0
it 's pretty obvious omar epps and tupac are awesome actors,0
besides the scientific aspect of all this let 's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story,0
personally i'm not such a big fan but can see why so many others are,0
the actors seemed to walk through their parts as if they simply sat in a sound booth and read lines they had never seen before,0
but do n't be fooled by the fact that springtime in a small town was set in the late '40s,0
there was no cake no salad watching it was like trying to eat a bucket of caesar dressing with a spoon,0
you ca n't really take one of the great tragedies and tack on a happy ending,0

i went through all of the stages of dying before the third season ended lingering a little longer at anger and denial than i think i will when the time actually does come,0
no point in making a movie that was already remade,0
he is not even remotely engaged in the story he is emotionally dead,0
conveniently he just happens to have a shotgun in his hands and immediately opens fire killing everyone,0
one would think that a film about a young person 's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring,0
i love this show and i just started watching it about three months ago,0
all in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat,0
granted the series is n't good history,0
but that 's because it did n't have the funding those movies had,0
you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement,0
and her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly particularly in the finale,0
we 'd fallen asleep by then,0
salome the production of which makes the shooting of apocalypse now seem like the filming of an average episode of friends took it 's creator five years to film featured epic battle sequences and required a huge cast and the construction of massive sets in the new zealand country side,0
lucas is an acclaimed gay playwright and is probably best known for his script for longtime companion a landmark in gay cinema,0

i'm sorry to say leonard nimoy 's dying king is nothing more than obligatory,0
carrot top is not an actor and is not funny in the slightest sense,0
the story is simple yet effective,0
'i claudius' shows just how important these things are and how unimportant those expensive special effects can be,0
it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful,0
however i was not happy with the writing and directing,0
this is one of those rare films that you recognize as a classic as you are watching it,0
as the viewer i felt transported back to 1992 having been 25 years old at the time this movie was released with no idea it even existed,0
do n't people around here lock doors,0
as such this film is a step up from black dawn and today you die his previous two poor poor movies,0
hal is working on his own escape plan which involves terry and her brother,0
it 's hollywood not espn,0
i give it a 65 or 7 out of ten,0
i'm sure he knew the networks were having a cow,0
in fact the song was made in 1980s by provincial young musicians who have never been to america,0
the pilot is in fact episode 11 this makes it possible to present small clues to upcoming episodes,0
but the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive,0
i think it 's a shame that the show 's writers stoop to such lows to hammer home over and over that kojak 's a cop on the edge willing to do whatever it takes to bring the bad man in blah blah blah,0
ok iam turning off the computer and yes i will get you a cookie big baby,0
i am very sure that the people at platinum dunes are very good at what they do and they consciously aim their releases at a specific genre audience and most of their films are a success in that respect but horsemen is a failure of diabolical proportions,0
always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen with a man trapped in space with his two funny wisecracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen,0
the person or persons that own the wrecking yard has a gold mine though,0
you just do n't see quality or realism like that these days,0
girls was also overlooked however and dick earned its reputation as the last decent carry on movie,0
just go along for the ride and enjoy the entertainment and entertaining it is,0
does anyone remember when mtv was n't full of shows that could n't be any less about music if they tried,0
some of this seems fairly reminiscent of that similarly awful rodman movie named double team which costarred jeanclaude van damme and mickey rourke,0
it was cheesy beyond redemption and the writers just try too hard,0
the problem here is a common one with low budget exploitation movies there 's a germ of a decent idea in here but the director and the screenwriter do n't know how to develop it,0
this movie beverly hills cop 2 is a very funny and action packed movie,0
after the first 15 minutes you 'll see why this film is free,0
while the film forum was showing a new 35 mm print with newly translated subtitles it was not pristine,0
had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson it would have been a disaster,0
the two are not the same,0
with this movie they 've made a good effort at achieving that title,0
each character is separate and unique each one has little personality quirks that makes it seem real,0
i 've often wondered just how much casper was meant for children with all the issues revolving around his identity as well as the disturbing message brought by this particular film,0
no you really really do n't,0
arbus one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century had a fascinating and dramatic life,0
the fact that the principal was a moron for falling for it,0
and the movie moves in the glacial pace that makes it atrocious to watch it is the cinematic exercise in tedium for the sake of artistic expression without tightening up,0
this is n't one of jackie chan 's better films,0
the seven ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the nypd,0
if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines then you will absolutely love this movie,0

if you 're in the mood for something of a nautical mood piece the adventures of merchant sailors from bar to bar the tragedy of being affiliated with the wrong ship naval warfare in the early twentieth century etc check this out,0
but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film,0
i actually thought he in his brief appearance made a decent clark kent,0
the gradual progress towards this point earns the creators lots of praise,0
there 's a bit of nudity but like the gore not much,0
in spanish with english subtitles,0
but i am guessing the script itself was so bad that the acting followed suit,0
like it sucked so bad i still ca n't believe it,0
it was the enjoyment of slumming without going through the danger,0
i like nukie because i feel sorry for it,0
but i only noticed one line which was cut at the moment when i expected to hear it and it was replaced by a look that said it all,0
the best gauge i can give you of how poor this movie was is that of a fairly full audience at my particular screening there were howls of laughter at the poor acting in seemingly dramatic and gripping moments of the film,0
it 's scarier deeper more complex and a far better story,0
editing was rough sound was off there was no color correction there were not even titles at the end of the film,0
like i said all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them,0
most of the action scenes are boring and that 's a problem since that 's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film,0
even though her character makes some mistakes in the beginning she has a big heart and lots of love for her beloved daughter,0
i 've shown this dvd to those who have never heard of rush or those who think rush is less than good because they do not appeal to the pessimistic masses of rock,0
the novelty of the concept flourishes with intelligence and vision but it felt like something you would find in an episode of the twilight zone,0
the horror is more in what is not shown but left to our imaginations,0
it just seemed like a job,0
they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation it was always just the two of us,0
the movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie killer husbandwife haunted house deranged surgeons ancient evil etc,0
there is not one person in this waste of 90 min of film that can act,0
but this is good company to be in,0
why do they bother at all,0
a brilliant satire of everything in australian society,0
spoiler i especially thought the finale was not big enough,0
it 's a lovely documentary to see because it talks a lot about what the actors directors producers of each films think about all four movies,0
the acting was alright but again there was n't anything to work with,0
this movie it 's excellent,0
the door that wo n't stay open,0
i also found the foley annoying because it was noticeable,0
the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion,0
you should see it gay or not because what matters in this world is also love,0
why the hell am i watching this,0
it does n't rank among his worst but it does n't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones either,0
overall this is a fun film i highly recommend it,0
bookwalter is still at it today nearly twenty years later and is just as talent deprived as he was when this piece of trash first came out,0
what was this movie actually about,0
an earlier review chastises the robert 's character for poisoning her husband,0
all would have deserved a better story,0
just because it 's an asian flick does n't automatically make it any good the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense it 's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production,0
i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time,0
having the point of view switch when the cops see the video was not only jolting but bad movie making because there was no reason beyond confusing the audience with facts that ca n't possibly fit the film thus far,0
showing situations that would normally shock anyone though the characters glide through these incredibly awkward scenarios with ease,0
while the city is being evacuated,0
also in the cast edmond o'brien ray collins joe sawyer and whit bissell,0
save you money and your time,0
a bad bad movie proving that gay men need to demand a little bit more quality from their artists,0
the show unlike many others digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction,0
can noah win over the people of parador,0

or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn and his girlfriend just goes oh my,0
if not so sue me,0
on the plus side psycho town does manage to build a smidgen of atmosphere in places,0
for kicks she and her three friends rob gas stations destroy schools and rape men,0
ridiculously laughable story hammy bad acting sub par music zero chemistry between the two romantic leads sticky sweet implausible plot are only a few of the ways i can describe this incredibly bad movie,0
jason stumbles forward always with little or no real incentive,0
this is the single worst movie i have ever seen,0
the sun spots allow his radio waves to traverse 30 years into the past to his father,0
the benefits we got out of so many young men and women dying became less clear,0
we figured ok the script sucks maybe we can do something at least visually,0
in short terms this movie is horrible,0
the funniest parts were the numerous pop culture references and jibes at modern day 21 century life,0
there 's a very clever ending too,0
must remain in a military jail,0
this is how people live in today 's independent and free india,0
galaxy of terror should have been a good film,0
the mental disorder issue and the issue of the truth of william keane 's lost daughter were eluded too,0
there are very few details about the war no politics no propaganda,0
but i concede that i am perhaps looking at it from a narrow point of view,0
i highly recommend you not watch it alone,0
i ca n't believe critics called this embarrassing and if you think van damme ca n't act you have to watch this movie plus joss ackland is pretty menacing as the main villain,0
during a party a bald person goes crazy and kills a couple of people but the wrong man gets accused of these murders,0
i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again,0
sigh why why why why,0
here it is fresh original shocking,0
for the most part this film works in spades,0
beyond this the reality of the movie is quite different,0
in the end the narrative approach works well and does not undermine the overall story or make it seem ridiculous despite the fact that the story does have a predictable element to it,0
connor mead used to be a once sensitive quiet guy and then has become a big jerk who is a big shot photographer now,0
this time the csi unit gets it right and is able to blow up the alicia photo proving that she 's living in a sanitarium only a few hours away,0
the first movie was just boring and eventually the snowman is destroyed by pouring antifreeze on him,0
also the sexiness of it sure did a lot to make me want to add this movie to my collection and watch it quite a bit,0
along with her twin brother david they search for reasons and clues regarding why all their friends are dying leading them to mary 's friend from 1969 grace,0
you do not have time to give a perfect answer urgency is there and it is for life or death,0
the animation was good sometimes really good though not nearly as good as the prerelease hype built it up to be but the story was weak,0
they were like puppets rejected from sesame street for looking too unfriendly,0
a british teen movies which centres around a girl accidentally creating her dream man in by the use of a virtual reality machine there is only one problem she gets trapped inside his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person she can trust,0
it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up,0
she says she gave those fairytales up a long time ago,0
things get worse and worse when they get deeper and deeper into trouble when more facts slowly surface,0
incredibly there 's a further change in store the end of the movie is really really absurd,0
totally pointless and exceedingly boring lowbudget sequel to the surprisingly popular and yet disappointing first film that starts off promisingly enough as it shows in black and white a young deformed boy being tortured by a group of teenage thugs that call themselves the blood wings or something similar to that,0
i 'll show you third grade,0
we thought it was brilliant from start to finish,0
however it looks to me like this is the same actress that played the first murdered prostitute in the movie,0
in the heady days of 1933 telephones and telegraphs eliminated the need for all that extra time,0
if only the movie was animated it would be a perfect simpsons satire of the stereotypical bad movie,0
if they wanted to work they would work,0
it 's painful to watch but at least it 's only for a minute or two,0
well the actor who plays charlie bartlett does a nice job,0
also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out,0
thoroughly laughable and unforgettably bad this is an exception bmovie,0
210 so very very cheesy,0
the humor frankly is n't too good and it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations,0
this love story makes the spine of this film with touching the heart of viewers in many parts of it,0
crackle basket i think that something bad is about to happen,0
please explain it to me,0
this finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere,0
i will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be,0
a woman walked out of the theater and asked me does this really happen,0
maybe my vote will help balance this out,0
i know it is very difficult to make a movie about foreign cultures free from misunderstandings and prejudice,0
what about an interesting script and good performances,0
it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal,0
by that i mean we get to see everyone fight new and old jedi and even stormtroopers,0
after some initial misgivings they take him into their hearts,0
i recommend this dvd to everyone i talk with about purchasing dvd 's,0
the script is awful much of the dialogue laughable if nothing else and even the most interesting scenes only inspire boredom,0
another criticism king raised was about the actors especially nicholson in the writer 's opinion his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane thus undermining the rest of the story,0
the mistress of spices had neither,0
i am only 16 years old and therefore i was raised into a world of modern effects and 3d animations in the movies,0
exactly copy of hollywood movie derailed for god sake these directors needs to stop doing plagiarism,0
it has it 's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate,0
by far one of the most boring horror movies in history,0
sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders,0
also i should mention that i do still watch spongebob which i know i 'll get a negative backlash for but that 's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it less we forget something icarly 's missing wit,0
although i have no problems with the latter part her performance does the movie no credit,0
rosa joins him a moment later rosa was the girlfriend of don vito and she was cheating on him with one of his crime lieutenant because she wanted to have sex with young meat,0
almost any movie starring brian bosworth is by definition a worse movie than the incubus,0
here 's to hoping she was burned alive or something,0
the movie crossfire is about a violently antisemitic gi who because of his own failures and frustrations in life takes it out on those of the jewish persuasion,0
i wo n't go into the plot but it is quite enjoyable to watch,0
however as the credits began to roll i could only think about how well the big bad swim compared to the others featured during the festival,0
hey i like happy endings too but this is too much and an insult to any viewer 's intelligence,0
but that 's enough about that,0
what really worries me is the same producing team and company is working on rambo 4 oh no,0
a film that makes you think is not one to avoid,0
i read other reviews that say something about jess franco having something to do with this movie,0
the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully,0
the monster musical has been a failed genre since the brave creation of the incredibly strange creatures like almost every monster musical before and since it has the distinctive characteristic of being truly awful,0
bob and alicia are in love and want to get married,0
the 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous the romance between kip and hannah is never completely believable and i feel the film could have done without it,0
back to the story the gang taste the lemonade to see if waldo made it right,0
you never see his body again,0
however the movie itself is supported strongly by the fantastic work of the acting especially lane because he is able to not only convince the audience about his character but have his character try and act as well thus creating multiple levels of personality hard to come to terms with inside of just one person,0
in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started that 's where the moral comes in,0
but i doubt that such repairs could rescue the film from the wreckage i saw,0
beautifully done like a dream with a purpose,0
renee zellweger not only holds her own in this exalted company but shines as streep 's daughter who learns to see in a new light her parents' lives as well as her own,0
if they had also worn spandex the headbands would have been understandable but wearing the armor all day every day as opposed to normal clothing was a bit trying on a person 's common sense,0
though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it,0
for those of us who knew james who was so witty and funloving the idea of his being a villain was ludicrous,0
the audience burst into cheers when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who were gravely beating up her brother in revenge,0
otherwise my best suggestion is for you to keep as far away from this movie as possible,0
unfortunately in this case it is in fact pretty bad,0
and to be fair it is more entertaining than say red zone cuba but not by much,0
that was a little funny and possibly more should have been done with this area,0

apparently i was tired of watching every action directors in hk imitating tsui hark john woo ringo lam and johnny to,0
he insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period,0
but those gushing elevators o' blood seen repeatedly in little danny 's visions are absurd and laughable,0
and third there 's some weird werewolf cult intent on taking over the world,0
not as good as the rest of the lineup but still funny,0

anthony hopkins john cusack mathew broderick dana carvey and bridgette fonda head an excellent cast of character actors,0
recent events and revelations have left him confused and emotionally overwhelmed,0

trying to look like a hero but he looks so bad,0
this film is not for all tastes just as conrad 's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes,0

almost all cast do n't play their character well exception for sophie and frederic,0
not once did i close my eyes in fear laugh or express any other emotions,0
of course that filler was filmed as if it were relevant and dramatic with hand held cameras and dramatic lighting no matter if it was just two guys speaking about nothing in a corridor,0
i have watched amanda bynes since all that she is truly a funny girl what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is its something that a person could here there best friend saying its not rehearsed,0
i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film,0
if you do n't understand then follow me after so many strange occurrences the viewer is so used to oddities that ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships sounds totally natural after seeing the rest of the movie,0
in the outlaw gang william smith who seems to have been in everything and you will recognize him the minute you see him does well as the seemingly retarded schoolboy,0
plus i assumed since the film is titled sorority house massacre it would be about a bunch of girls being stalked by a psychotic killer and not a bunch of girls and their boyfriends,0
and so we 're left wondering,0
and what 's with the depiction of running,0
i would have loved to have been at the red carpet black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath it is on the dime dvd racks now look for it for entertainment value this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up,0
i did n't mind that flex did not look like michael jackson i thought he did the best he could but later on when he had all that white makeup on oh man did he look yucky,0

plus a lot of the dialog is simplistic cartoonlike ie,0
the first time was for probably the best movie i 've ever seen and that was for memento,0
for starters the movie deals with the legend of big foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature,0
it does n't work as a standalone film,0
whatever the reason i am glad that we can at least say that bette walked off because this stain on her glorious career is as bad as i have ever seen,0
there are snowy mountains in the far distance,0
the start of the film just was so uncoordinated while searching for the girl his fat enemy who mind you put up a huge fight by being chucks punching bag get 's thrown out of a window only to hear chucks reason for it,0
i ca n't believe it took three people to write this movie,0

which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 110 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have stephanie beaton,0
this flick is bad and i mean bad,0
why make a film set in ireland then cast all main characters as american i 'll never understand but it explains why the film was so obsessed with promoting ireland as some sort of drug paradise,0
on the contrary if this has any value as masturbation material then frankly the filmmaker did n't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on,0
it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john 's doorstep,0
some of the situations character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who 's complaining,0
if you want the real linda story though you may have to get it from one of the bios written about her but not this movie,0
pretty good and equally unlikely and likely but an interesting and fairly valid idea in any case,0

when the boy teaches spiders to create the bridge especially after a lifetime as a mediocre student i 'd have him off to a psychiatrist pronto,0
even though the hosts are n't as geek as i 'd like them to be i still have found attack of the show to be entertaining even with its latest lineup,0
i liked many points of the movie some of the quotes really cheered me up but the stereotyped characters are present again like in every hungarian film and the story is also pretty dull,0
at this point there is barely a string connecting the beginning of the movie to the middle,0
a well made movie definitely worth watching,0
why would we want to root for lola,0
what was scary was not only just those deformed billy brothers but the family in which they come from again i will not say since this is a twist and i do n't want to ruin it but that realization is far more disturbing than those evil twins,0
to an extent the movie does show how doctors are willing conspirators or accomplices in the process,0
this is a action packed movie from beginning to end with the assault on the suburban scene and every scene with the paramilitary strike force team,0
let 's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent,0
actually the first several scenes are from rushmore,0
overall i liked that movie,0
the scene where the old woman bends down and touches dung that was on the floor then puts it to her nose and goes chupacabra,0
this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film,0
as a guy from a relatively square state i have news for wally white first you might be part of a minority but this kind better than thou behavior is n't far off from what fueled such lovely historical eras such as nazi germany,0
basically it 's nothing more than trash worth 5 million,0
the original music score is also far better than the disney remix,0
the main difference is that the bad news bears gets the baseball details right whereas few american films have portrayed hockey in a realistic way,0
i used to sit at home in my room every sunday evening just before 7 needing to watch this show,0

save your money if you 're looking for a good haunted house flick,0
this is a story about a piano prodigy and his strangely gifted family,0
crawford usually played such serious roles and rarely had a chance to show his comic flair but in this movie he gets his chance and he does a very good job,0
this time around there are two main characters who find themselves and their home transported to a mysterious white void,0
the story moves all too quickly because you want it to last,0
wow what an overrated movie this turned out to be,0
then the black and white look that keeps you edgy through the whole movie is truly excellent and the score by andy daniels is incredible in my opinion,0
it was overdone both acting wise and in the direction,0
on a side note the lighting of this film was awful making all of the actors look terrible,0
there 's a reason why this film took a limited release and little fanfare despite having some solid actors in the lineup,0
richard pryor was really one of the most definitive standup comedians of all time,0
i would rather watch play school,0
sheldon the groom is already nervous and he twitches even more with fleas up his trousers concerning the bride and the justice of the peace,0
some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling,0
definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying,0
though the disorganized gang 's central enterprise seems to be drug dealing ed harris is ready to pull some sideline gigs merely as a public duty,0
there are a few creepy moments though and at times the music works well but overall the film isnt that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director,0
the acting is tremendous performed by an allstar cast who play the high society new york perfectly,0
so my advice is do n't watch this film,0
but they put it on video anyway along with most of the other creaky lowbudget b horror flicks of the golden age of television,0
it 's sad fact that most porn stars do n't look anything like the lead here just a bad dye job and a boob job,0
but despite the outstanding acting and story the real stars here are the music and the italian settings,0
his parents ca n't bear to look at him either,0
the audience is invited to a party and like any good party the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the next,0
i remember how sad and upsetting it was it truly made me sick to my stomach,0
had you not known how bad most 1929 and even 1930 films were then i could see you complaining about the sound,0
naschy 's facial expression never varies whether in or out of makeup and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf,0
here director john madden takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off,0
i have never read gibson 's original story,0
but here i said stop,0
all in all it 's an entertaining film that steals more money in it 's plot than time from you,0
if you want to see all the gory deaths later on you can choose to do so in the deleted scenes section,0
the two families do n't mix well and the movie basically portrays their interactions,0
all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil,0
just when you think things have to get better they get worse,0
l'appartement sucks you in from the beginning and the twists and turns keep you thrilled until the very end,0
and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you overall a very good looking film,0
i just learned of it today and while i know it 's silly i 've been sitting here at work getting tearyeyed,0
dear me i think i was not very happy when i saw this sequel,0
as the headaches and the bills start piling up so do the laughs,0
the daughter is a bad actress she does n't even get naked which is a standard in bad horror movies,0
this one was bad but i 've seen worse pictures,0
siobhan is the only actual mistress and she 's getting herself in proper trouble,0
i do n't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow,0
we at least see the children and the priest in one scene prior to their being chased by the monster,0
you must see this movie,0
i'm not a skateboarder i do n't particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture,0
this film is so laughingly bad that it 's hilarious,0
gleason was a comic genius but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in the hustler and soldier in the rain,0
i had no expectations when i started to watch this movie,0
the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels,0
it 's like that bizzare santa clause vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes,0
drifting around on bootlegs sometimes thought an urban comic book legend the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears,0
after the third wallace and gromit short there was all this speculation about a fulllength wallace and gromit movie yet for years nothing had happened,0
this is doubly unfortunate as he is the main character,0
then she and earl 's extremely stupid brother then had sex,0
thank you and i hope you want this movie back too,0
i am not familiar with the afghan culture and i did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter and yesterday i decided to watch this movie on dvd,0
it 's not an oscar flick but well worth the effort unless the viewer is so into brain dead violence that it hurts to have to think for longer than a second,0
for everyone else not essential but great saturday night fair,0
the running joke of the kingdom 's history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled,0
it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons or they are just simply dumb,0
nothing ever happens to make you reexamine or change your outlook on the game 's events,0
dw griffith also used the montage but no one mastered it so well as eisenstein,0
there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people,0
plus our heroine 's sister is little more than the grinch in human form all of which could in better hands have proven to be a decent little seasonal movie it certainly has good intentions on its side and is n't too shameless in its pitch for the touched by an angel audience,0
the viewer gets the sense that she does n't enjoy what she is doing but sacrifices have to be made in life,0
it 's clear from the get go that ryan 's howard wilton is a dangerously troubled man but this is a different sort of peril movie,0
i do not think it would have worked quite the same if the second act were expanded and turned into a sequel,0
here is an undeniable truth of movie reviewers when you really want to promote a movie that 's not that good talk about the great performances of the actors,0
but the problem is jason leaves his homework in the car the other way of saying this is marty wolf steals it,0
when we first meet ann she 's getting arrested by a store detective in a department store after attempting to steal an expensive piece of jewelry,0
you think it 's a horror flick but needed it is another troma ripoff,0
i 've seen people who know what really is important in life,0
irene dunne is amazing in a layered performance that is both subtly affecting and sidesplittingly funny sometimes within the same scene,0
unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail,0
just like watching a letterbox film on television after the first five minutes my mind settled into the tempo and pacing and i really did enjoy the story,0
it has some events that seem forced and unlikely like when cal and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place,0
based on what i 've seen banderas attempt to do in this film it seems that the book must have been a challenging adaptation,0
he suspects foul play by city officials,0
it 's a nicely constructed story with good acting from everybody involved,0
this competition is at it 's core funny two brothers who dislike eachother so much they even compete at a funeral it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in asian comedy,0
sadly this does n't happen,0
and yet we are meant to believe that this woman has a major confidence problem hence the scene in which she prepares to start playing the flute for a solo concert and somehow manages to throw the notes on the ground out of nervousness,0
this is my first review as i felt compelled to write to say just how bad this film is,0
i just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there,0
rate it a six maybe seven but definitely worth watching,0
he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two,0
for bmovie fans seeking out a crapfest you could do much worse than this,0
why give the guy a wash if he 's in for a torture,0
this whole thing is ridiculous,0
orson welles portrays a wwii vet who will not allow himself to ruin his wife 's new life,0
it 's so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i wo n't mention anything more about the plot,0
while that flick was no masterpiece it was head and feet above these slow dumbed down tv movies,0
the contrast of a wonderful romance against all the grotesque imagery is very effective as it brings an element of reality to the film,0
in this version they choose to plug that event in at the end of the movie leaving viewers wondering why,0
would it have mattered if it were n't pretty,0
add to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker,0
who the hell was jill wagner screwing behind the scenes,0
i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile,0
this would be the only exception i will make about seeing a film at home over a movie theatre because at home you can turn it off,0
however this short i think everyone can agree is just not good,0
me too guys me too,0
side note if you enjoyed this film then i suggest that you also watch mind game,0
the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went thats a good forest,0
this is filmmaking at its most selfassured and unapologetic,0
settings are awful actors others than the two stars are mediocre,0
pursued is a very decent picture very nicely shot darkly imaginative and dripping with noir style but if it 's actually a noir film then that really is up for debate as is if this film really is a western,0
there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits unlike the much worse 1997 film mr magoo which opened using clips of the original cartoon,0
so why 7 out of 10 stars,0
this new miss marple was in her own way as absurd a creation as margaret rutherford 's version,0
i suspect much more of the film would have made sense to me had i known more about egyptian culture,0
however in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions,0
this qualifies as a family film though there are a few stabbings near the end,0
most of the movies he 's been in had parts written especially for him but this was perfect,0
the only actor in the movie who is enhanced by this entire affair is amy poehler who is far better used here than she ever was in blade of glory,0
it 's an extremely frustrating movie to watch and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off because it was so bad,0
there were only two complaints about the film,0
at the snack counter a poster proclaimed one of the most uplifting and optimistic movies of the year,0
and so it goes with one complication following another until the conclusion,0
now snoopy come home is not as good as the first movie but it is memorable not because it completes the feeling of the peanuts world as the first movie did but because it 's arguably the most saddening,0
he redefines what the term evil villain means,0
hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was,0
when i urge those to seek it out they have never heard of the film,0
the purpose of these films takes place in about 65 minutes so they all pretty much have the same requirements if you know what i mean,0
i think its great that the scifi channel premiered this movie and i cant wait for the sequel,0
so mark and daria 's brief tryst is quite poignant because it does n't get to develop into a fullblown romance,0
just accept the movie 's premise a bunch of idiotic guys do weird crap for fun,0
some have justly criticized this film for moralizing too much,0
this is the moment when i thought that at long last this movie was finally going to settle down to its purpose of entertaining us,0
i do n't know why people think its a bad movie i own it and watch it regularly,0
neither tells anyone that they were married but it 's obvious that her ex wants the new and improved norma back,0
and interestingly enough i'm sure it was placed at the end as a comment on the nature of such dreams,0
i do n't know i just really feel like my time was wasted with from dusk till dawn 2 texas blood money,0
i detest custer and all he did postcivil war,0
then there 's the direction,0
but after seeing the film it 's easy to understand why,0
as the movie progresses of course the similarities end but wag the dog is worth seeing too,0
leslie fenton the director made the best of it,0
i mean what more can be done with the old woman inside mans body storyline,0
my love goes to joseph merrick where ever he may be,0
there are moments where the camera work is most excellent and combined with the story like when he is waiting to see the superintendent very well done,0
the rest of the film shows attitudes that i witnessed a lot people dealing with hard lives or taking a swing at the music industry andor lousy hippies,0
i watched this movie again after many years tonight,0
the actor playing rochester needs to show us the character of the man and this is fulfilled to perfection,0
when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind ahmed 's perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues,0
and the brunette actress has a single body has one breast slightly bigger,0
that he chose differently is his responsibility,0
this movie is actually part of the french 2000 as seen by,0
the acting actually is n't so bad,0
if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile not a gator,0
she resents the good people of king 's bay capitalizing on the disaster yet she has no misgivings whatever in playing on amundsen 's sense of guilt to get him to mount a rescue attempt,0
i cried my eyes out almost through the entire movie,0
you are muslim 's living in india and i am sure you have gone through some tough experiences but you do n't have to show your loyalty to india in this cheap and crass way,0
like imdb there seemed to be a lack of listing the song credits here too,0
this was a boring pointless exercise designed to shock,0
everything is supposed to be funny but it is n't,0
this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument,0
we should all congratulate uwe boll,0
for the moment there are too many artificial movies full of tragedies and scifi not like this one great script tragedy fear and of course eliza dushku,0
i have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with affleck,0
this may actually be the worst movie that i have ever scene,0
it does n't really make a whole lot of sense but neither did the superman movies if you think about them too much,0
i 'd never heard of this then found out it 's the man with the deadly lens which i 'd heard of but not seen,0
in less than ten words my tv guide has hit the nail on the head i mean it 's a scifi action film it certainly stars mario van peebles it 's definitely dire,0
lance henriksen is harlan knowles a character who could have been interesting if he was n't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality,0
wendy just understands something about the perverse peter pan in neil that even he does n't understand about himself,0
the thing that really had me going though was not the music but the ending i suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil but when the american ninja drops the girl into jackson 's arms and then takes off his mask i wanted to see him jump off the roof and jackson drop the girl to catch him,0
how good is gwyneth paltrow,0
the story of four kids lost on the streets of chicago one night,0
the music score by max steiner enhances the film although it feels obtrusive at times,0
the songs save for one are all forgettable and i doubt the one that is ok will leave its mark too,0
i was at my friends house and he had just started watching it so i sat down thinking we would shoot the breeze whilst this was playing in the background,0
pc plod is then assigned to solve the murders he comes to the grizzly yet strikingly obvious conclusion that lillith is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire dispatching tools including a cross garlic and a sharpened piece of wood,0
how can you set out to make a documentary about asking someone out when the protagonist is such a pussy,0
now on to the crawlers,0
they are a pleasant team the plot is interesting and mysterious but the resulting film is very dull,0
the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade,0
this is not a spoiler,0
some of the characters are hardbitten and streetwise and the profanity is used as a natural spice but not gratuitously,0
myra breckinridge does n't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty,0
just skip to the last ten minutes to have a laugh with the crap cgi,0
i especially liked the opening scene which showed the power workout before breakfast,0
if you thought those cliches were n't bad enough check out the cardboard cutout characters including the obvious villain the obligatory asian male with platinum blonde hair the little boy whose life is saved by woodbine in a climatic scene i could go on but i have other things to gripe about,0
not an awful film by any means but not much originality went into it either,0
who wants to be in it,0
you really should n't be so careless with your belongings,0
the picture also boasts a terrific music score by the underrated and now wholly forgotten film composer frank skinner,0
the dialogues were so run of the mill,0
with all these horror remakes floating about i think this is one of the better attempts,0
however that 's not saying much,0
it 's definitely in the style of airplane and scary movie,0
the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped the plot contrived the acting bad and the motivations clueless,0
i'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie and i'm being generous that there was even a plot to begin with,0
but this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up beside sean obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience,0
the acting is n't exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience,0
another thing i noticed about this movie is that me and my friends were the only ones to laugh during the entire movie,0
some of it is so contrived and poorly written it 'll literally make you cringe,0
lew has benevolent plans he sees sam as the first atomic man a pure killing machine in human form,0
rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world,0
those puppies were absolutely adorable,0
in a series of different chapters the story is repeated all based around each character in turn,0
he is concerned about people without wearing it on his sleeve gruff even curt but letting us glimpse the tenderness behind it and he is wise not only a clever detective but wise in the ways of the human heart,0
my only criticism is its poor production values,0
but do n't get me wrong,0
i can see this film challenging the majority of so called masterpiece films in the theater right now probably putting most of those films to shame,0
it does n't have a plot or story,0
at least give the audience a final girl to root for,0
when the actor 's face on the screen would seem to denote that he is yelling the dubbed voice sounds calm,0
the plot is amazing the acting is amazing and the directing is amazing,0
critics love him and i think he is one of the best filmmakers,0
emmanuelle devos who plays carla has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame,0
the music did not go along with the visual images,0
did they even read the script before accepting this acting gig,0
look at the number of film festival awards the fly boys has received,0
he 's the only cast member to return and sadly they kill him off to make way for a new character his brother bobby,0
it certainly starts out well enough,0
all in all i would recommend that no one watch this unless you are bored out of your mind and have too much money and not enough sense,0
why that irritating smug grin throughout the film,0
i also wondered about cloud 's past but that was easy enough to look up,0
mr rogers would have sounded like a more menacing pirate captain than the stooge playing him,0
i do not suggest watching this movie unless you have some time to waste that you will never need back,0
florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family,0
tony todd 's voice will tingle your spine there 's enough gore for slasher film addicts to keep interested but do n't let that blind you to the smart elegantly crafted story underneath,0
as the series progresses though it should find its niche and perfect its style,0
this movie is so slow and pointless it was painful,0
then a long time passed before any real suspense built up,0
then once you 're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there is n't one it 's serious though it 's hard to tell what they 're trying to accomplish,0
i loved the writing and acting especially from the guy that played the lead role,0
molly ringwald was fantastic as the spoilt bitchy american actress hating every minute of working with the amateur australian film crew,0
when something happens the reactions of the characters are vague and dry,0
the more he sees of beautiful crystal too the more he is attracted to her,0
an angry fat woman screaming is the scariest sight to behold on the face of this earth,0
the production values are top notch all around but the plot is utterly senseless,0
this is a woman who men are drawn to,0
however as with so many others its laughs all round due to the shockingly bad script plot etc,0
if lost can carry on it 's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever,0
the key moments of the story seem implausible for example when hurst accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be chaplin,0
i had already submitted some but from now on i will write in order,0
little dakota fanning makes a huge impression as intelligent spunky lucy,0
this a real movie about thug life and the inescapable revolving door trap that is so hard to break,0

these are the moments where the program shines but just are n't enough to make for the shortcomings in other episodes,0
i did n't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here but it 's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it 's cult status and eventually led to a dvd release in 2002 if you 're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably is n't your cup of tea but trust me there are worse films of this type out there and despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare,0

the film itself epitomises his daring nobody had ever released a major theatrical feature of a standup comedy performance before and no movie studio wanted it,0

we see through flash backs that terrible things happened to them in the past at their school,0

director hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here it shows the entire thing takes place in two houses the desert some caves a miniature golf course,0
in lieu of dialogue the film relies exclusively on young 's lyrics which are heavily laced with sociopolitical commentary to tell the story while actors act out the scenes,0
that said there were several fantastic comedic moments in the film and unlike other raucous comedies there was no endless parade of fart jokes and tired oneliners,0
unfortunately the script and elaboration are far too messy to make it become a memorable film and i simply ca n't recommend it wholeheartedly even though i really wanted to,0

but most importantly it 's peck 's chance to regain his humanity by facing up to the odds not just for his own survival but for his two comrades as well,0
the guys just seem so lovely down to earth and it has to be said very attractive,0
but in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise,0
it is unintentionally more funny than scary and obviously the makers of this pathetic waste of film thought we 'd all enjoy a typical yet much more awful teen slasher flick,0
a typical franco movie who continues to move towards pure sex movies and leaving the horror genre altogether keeping up with the zeitgeist,0
the subplots bore no relation that i could see to the main plot all of them could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story which surely suggests a fundamental flaw,0
the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex,0
with its story of a friendly alien who is hunted by the local law enforcers but befriended by two children who help him repair his flying saucer,0
dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart,0

b grade is always good for a laugh,0
sleepwalking down the street dressed in pajamas bowler he is indeed a very droll sight,0

overall i found this to be an amusing film but still it 's a touch on the light side a little more black humor could have made it a bit better,0
as far as entertainment well it 's not at all,0
i watched this movie on vcd in the home of a local couple on a very remote island in indonesia,0
yuck the characters in this film lack both adrenaline and drive the casting director i think was too good for the film 's own good and our humdrum hero and heroine just never seem to get the action nor the romance in gear,0
he owns a nightclub where she dances,0
in this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric australian filmmaking,0
when i say it is a wonderful small film i do n't mean budget or quality,0
not to mention the daily chores and regular haircuts,0
ultimately i abandoned the effort,0

oh by the way if you were wondering they were not using sign language in the film,0
august rush is a masterpiece,0
i screened it among a film society audience of highly forgiving film lovers and i believe it was the first film shown in our forum to have had audience members leave continuously throughout the movie,0
fred astaire great especially playing those organ fingers,0
batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1851 but this dvd is presented in 1331 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides,0
i have heard people say that this film is just stupid well they are right it is about 2 stupid guys doing a stupid thing in a stupid way and you just love them to bits for it okay it was not forest gump in the way tom hanks played the slow guy come good with what i would say was one of the best performances by any actor of all time but it was very funny,0
its not scary but a movie with no head and tail,0
i do n't think it 's really his fault mind you but the script that allowed for no slow and logical progression of his moodiness,0
a monolith in cinematic history 2001 is a high water mark of direction execution and achievement,0
it 's a hodgepodge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the alltime worst acting you 'll ever have the misfortune to see,0
the action is top notch,0
it 's simply just a fun movie that is good to show some of your friends for some laughs,0
many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing,0
i hope the rest of it is as good,0
i do n't mean to demean vengo when i say it 's use of music is more like that in forrest gump or almost famous where music sets the mood or anchors us in a time and place as the story flows,0
also similar to director lewis' terror in a texas town though thankfully not as goofy or campy,0
his characterization in this movie is subtle we only ever get to know the characters through their plight 's and not through their character,0
then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic,0
though other songs are good too but it is matter of personal choice too,0
you can also tell bobby is a loner because every time something big happens he goes off by himself and gets drunk,0
i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it,0
when we all know no one does it like the bbc,0
on a positive note the performances and music were very good,0
this once did n't have it,0
it 's not sexual attraction that brings them together but need and confusion,0
the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white,0
i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script,0
also the boy knox who woos the girl i found unbelievable,0
this one falls into the second category,0
in one scene it looks like one of the eyes in it was burned out,0
the future of american gay rights was the prize to be won and it is very very close,0
just a terrible climax following a tiresome 80 or so minutes of wasted time,0
instead of shooting themselves with said semen in the head or face they place the gun in their mouths,0
this is one of those films with a great potential,0
suddenly a blond godlike looking hero with a bad wig appears saying that 's my horse,0
the world war to which matheson only alluded was made explicit,0
the best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the driveby,0
if you like serene but intense story lines this is a must see film,0
what a film what a cast what music,0
i 'd have liked to have looked out for the depictions in the film,0
i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic so it was n't just ignorance that brought them to make this film,0
hats off to the actors for having the guts to make it,0
some examples are why does the main character reject her oldest son,0
a cute little kiddie flick,0
the dialog is as stiff as wood,0
he does gets seduced by the femme fatale but it does n't even cause him to lose his fiance,0
i am a very jaded viewer but some of those early mortuary scenes really get under your skin,0
maybe then it would n't be so insulting,0
i believe most people would identify with buddy almost losing his best friend who he raised from birth,0
the sets are either obviously something else or so minimal as to be distractingly laughable,0
it did n't have an ounce of believability anywhere,0
sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way,0
i barely laughed and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie,0
the ending of the film during the showing of dolce vita was too corny clich and quite disappointing,0
there are many other movies available that succeed with that very point and i 'll include their titles in the recommendations portion of this section,0
they never really explain the legend behind the title nor does the movie actually involve the tower except in a very deux ex machina way,0
it 's so entertainingly terrible it 's almost worth more praise,0
the major has reason to suspect that there is a hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country,0
i see a number of viewers gave this film such high praise and i ask for what,0
in a way the circus is n't a masterpiece nor a perfect film nor even a particularly great one but in another way it is all those things and more,0
even though one of them is her husband she sees no problem with being unfaithful with the other man because i must do it to survive,0
the group is an odd mix of good and evil young and old,0
otherwise you may want to skip this one,0
worse than the old quincy,0
clint eastwood has created a masterpiece of film,0
even an american viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings,0
this movie was made for barker fans,0
basically it conquered the world is the original invasion of the body snatchers meets the day the earth stood still and the quality of those two movies only underscores how pitiful this one looks by comparison,0
yes the accents were a little extreme and fake at some points but for the most part i loved it,0
so i say enough already,0
as always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button,0
my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense,0
i assumed when i saw the disc available that it was the sequel to ninja scroll and thus not happy when i found out it was n't,0
and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable i can see why it has n't been rebroadcast anytime recently,0
it also has a really good ending which is very important,0
he was famous for finding obscure films and directors and showcasing them to the hollywood elite,0
covers this period and together with the earlier volumes in the series shows clearly the existing conditions i feel,0
before embarking on his own journey,0
as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him fires explosions as well as impaling could stop the crazed miner,0
when she was lucid she made sense,0
the plot in general is a confusing mess,0
unfortunately it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy instead of this lame dull boring excuse for a comedy,0
it 's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like haiku tunnel there 's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths,0
the trouble is that this story unlike richard beasley 's satirical hell has harbour views is meant to be a serious morality play,0
harding is a woman who believes in marrying for love but gets pushed into trapping powell into marriage,0
this is just not intense enough for me,0
any way the joke in our family has always been to call our father the third bigot,0
i guess we 're not supposed to ask,0
and you get so long to think about them too,0
but as i watched it i found it interesting and i wanted to see more of it,0
there 's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood,0
altogether the character played is fascinating and odd an english eccentric or a gay characterization,0
as for trent ford i'm not going to discuss his looks other than in this statement because i do n't think criticizing an actors appearance does any good,0
with everyone else getting killed all through the movie i wondered why frank did n't just blow johnny 's brains out,0
the film was obviously shot on sets and very little location work is done,0
two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by life,0
this is your standard musical comedy from the '30 's with a big plus that it features some well known '30 's actors in small fun cameo 's,0
the concept of the movie is very interesting,0
and it has too many flaws there 's literally no effective creativity and it just does n't work,0
why could n't they just keep the camera on that for 90 minutes,0
taj admits that he stole the test materials so that his pals can continue to compete in the tournament,0
however what does give the film some extra quality is the approach in which the material is taken on,0
it 's very confusing but that 's only one of its many problems,0
but she cannot stop me from saying this movie absolutely sucks,0
an absorbing analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option,0
instead this one is mounted with lowbudget production values with no subtlety at all,0
the first two texas chainsaw films are great and i really enjoyed them,0
this kind of story became a great gothic romance in dracula,0
we then have a supposed rocker uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap,0
i highly recommend watching this if you do n't mind b movies,0
there is a vibrant joyful mood conveyed in those boxing scenes,0
the opportunity is here to build an atmosphere to draw an audience into a movie,0
this is telemovie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production,0
so what is good about this film,0
first of all the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies,0
the men in his family all died by the age of 45 so he figured he was n't going to live a long life and therefore did n't see a need to take good care of himself,0
the performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish,0
to facilitate the actors' return to their day jobs waiting tables none were required to change their hairstyles at all,0
but thankfully it 's got bela lugosi in it,0
the film is honest about why the moms are in prison and the failures of the program as well as the successes,0
a piece of dialogue that could have torn you with laughter will take your heart,0
while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically it appears noone told his costars they were not in a comedy,0
i was talking about closet space mallory says to alex,0
watching it i could see parallels of cinematography used today,0
it 's an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at,0
derek is lovely as always and still playing nave especially during a muddled midsection which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa,0
everything could take its toll especially the sea,0
a juicy bit of 70s kitsch right here for your viewing pleasure,0
but instead all i got was him drinking and kicking his annoying teenager son in the ass which as annoying as he was it was nice,0
and frankly it 's heather graham we could care less about her after a while,0
well this is the case here,0
they 're two grown men to whose home is their garage attached,0
in the mean time pusser tries to get on with the highway patrol but is,0
yeah maybe he was there the last 6 times,0
any film featuring j t walsh is ok,0
maybe possible spoiler sorry but i'm afraid to say i disliked this movie,0
if you do n't believe me check out the reviews every single review i have seen of this movie is negative,0
blood lake is boring beyond words without any noteworthy highlight,0
and rather than just whine and complain i call for a remake but this time let 's do it right,0
the sets and fighting scenes are poor,0
teenagers adults senior citizens they should all watch to see that being older does n't mean your dead from the waist down,0
2 in another as he flees from the posse his borrowed horse steps into a gopher hole and breaks a leg,0
cool quotes as these can also be found i did n't even like elizabeth the golden age,0
ambiguity 's a storyteller 's tool,0
i cant remember the last time something was this painful to watch,0
it is a tragic tale of how a young girl can be abused by a older man,0
that is exactly what i did while watching this movie,0
from that point on i just could n't take the movie seriously,0
there 's no one shred of good dialogue and not one likable character,0
one of the stupid things i noticed in it though was the mutants,0
the curse of monkey island is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at lucasarts to have created this sequel,0
marisa tomei while i 've never been a big fan of hers was more than suitable for the role and worked well,0
i 've now came to the conclusion that those reviews could only have been written by the film makers,0
thats right they pile into the back seats and he is sat in the middle of them,0
just do n't eat anything before you watch it,0
i know that the intrepid crew is being harassed by magical forces and enemies etc,0
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas,0
things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee,0
great song too many characters not enough time suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency and it just falls apart in your hands,0
i watched it recently and i liked it more than i had done since i was under 6 or something,0
the crew gets eaten to,0
this film is surprisingly appalling,0
alright we start in the office of a shrink and apparently not a very good one,0
just imagine escaping the norm as we are so use to living and being in existence from birth being young and living life till our old body gives out,0
tell your friends to save their money and hardearned cash and stay the hell away from the santa clause 3 they will thank you for it in the end i promise,0
rajesh khanna has also given an oscar performance,0
i eventually got the name of the title and bought the movie,0
naturally jaspers jumps at the chance to sell his soul for revenge but he later regrets it when he turns into a horned demon i'm actually quite a big fan of brian yuzna i would n't hesitate to call the likes of society and return of the living dead 3 modern horror masterpieces but faust love of the damned is undoubtedly his worst film,0
who was the male werewolf following her,0
a couple beers will help you bear it,0
it was far from a reinvention,0
that 's why i turned it off after the first four hours,0
the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny,0
these guys just have it,0
those two look like they were made for each other,0
as for the men in the bowling alley they do n't really have a story so i wo n't ask them personal questions but together we can feel better than them,0
within an abandoned rural farmhouse stargher locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies,0
bottom line the films has it 's faults and is not a martial arts epic but it does n't try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action,0
is it really their purpose to destroy the world,0
in conclusion although this movie has it 's flaws it 's very sexy and definately worth a rent,0
at a running time of approximately two hours and forty minutes the film recreates a piece of history sought with fragility and values conveyed to the viewer,0
touching and sad this comedy is more depressing than funny,0
if you do n't agree with this review that fine it 's just my own opinion and i'm sure someone out there will love it,0
i 've greatly enjoyed their earlier comedic efforts,0
in a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire,0
i have to admit that the ending of this hitchcock film surprised me,0
all in all i thought it was a pretty good movie,0
you really believe what they say,0
magnani is a semi demented inhabitant of a village where she meets a stranger played by federico fellini that she believes to be saint joseph,0
what 's a man to do,0
if not then you probably have his face on a tshirt somewhere and you did n't know,0
i also refuse to believe anyone would knowingly make anything so bad,0
this little piece of trash is so bad it 's embarrassing to watch,0
one suspect goes on behaving suspiciously and letting the cops think what they will and it 's never explained why,0
this might be called the turn as the setup takes on a startling twist,0
the sole chance it got is to be so bad it turns comic,0
if you 're looking for clear plot payoffs this is a movie for which you should probably wait on the dvd,0
three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas,0
i'm going to take one last risk by telling you that what you 'll see must happen every day in many cities of the earth,0
and the worst case scenario is that the actors do n't even seem to think about what kind of movie they are acting in,0
it 's not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie,0
the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but wheres the experiment,0
even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like he 's half asleep most episodes,0
there is loss and the promise of retribution,0
if this was the best dutch cinema had to offer these years my worst fears have come true,0
there are some very little plot holes,0
watch it when you have the time,0
this is the kind of western that only stewart not wayne nor scott could have pulled off,0
lastly original actorsactresses and if they do n't participate at least get actorsactresses people can actually like,0
just to be clear there 's no padding in this film in the long pauses where no one speaks there as much happening in the characters' emotions as you could bear,0
savage island is a very lowbudget movie with a stupid screenplay amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting,0
i rated it out of 10 stars,0
overall i found this film to be very entertaining,0
yes he was a little mad and his methods were rough but he was still a human not a totally insane figure as portrayed in inglorious bastards,0
the music is superb with all the songs being hits,0
what she 'd rather do is scheme with family lawyer hume cronyn and family doctor harold gould to get douglas sent to the booby hatch,0
it is unwatchable and pointless,0
who comes up with such plots,0
they also provide the humor,0
figuratively speaking friend seems to be a representation of dern 's transition from childhood to womanhood not a real person,0
to see faye dunaway christopher plummer and diana quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime,0
the movie is in a flashback,0
regardless it 's a surprisingly involving movie with a mature perspective on love and war a curio sadly forgotten today and well worth a look now,0
keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact,0
the movie plummets from there unfortunately,0
we can read frustrations yearnings desperation anger hope loss and a range that is way out reach for a lot of the marketable types that hollywood constantly push down our throats,0
at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wildeyed craziness,0
quite a fast mover by any standards i'm sure you 'll agree,0
of course there 's a sadness and elegiac sensation for fans in watching this posthumous film and it 's also fair to say the music is n't always topdrawer beatles only mccartney brings his best work to the party although john and especially george would recover their chops in time for abbey road,0
he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly does n't have the guts to actually do it himself,0
it was n't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other and blah blah blah you were n't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together,0
i was lucky enough to have seen the show when it was originally broadcast,0
if you can get past the somewhat corny style you 'll really enjoy what old films could do better than all our contemporary technology,0
sometimes she is sweeter than chocolate with sugar,0
one night mircalla kills her lesbian roommate and then when she finds out that giles knows about her she kills him also,0
what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman,0
frederick forsyth 's books are always so intricately plotted with twists and turns and usually a great surprise ending,0
hopefully they release a full length version in the future,0
worse yet the africanamerican hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy ethan hawke which makes this assault less progressive than the 1970s one,0
what i thought was the worst was the one with marilyn manson,0
um i mean evil head,0
more importantly he 's also very good at showing human nature in general,0
the plot takes plenty of surprising turns and the final sick twist raised a smile or two,0
as a lesson good actors do n't always mean good film makers,0
as stated before there are some actors that are good in every film and bette davis is one of those actors,0
by making a war film boll has proved himself yet again as a completely derivative and wannabe director who is not concerned with either originality artistic impact or entertainment value,0
the truth is what you make it,0
i viewed this movie for the first time last night and i enjoyed every aspect of it the dancing the acting the dialogue the plot the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created,0
granted i 've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality,0
however i found this to be very amusing and enjoyable with many good laughs,0
after an unexpected visit by his former fiance he accepts her offer to become father of her child her child and her lesbian lover 's child,0
the story was abysmal the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through it just completely becomes forgotten,0
it is equally about totally mad and insane courage to turn your life around as it is about failure and it should be praised for showing that,0
wants to get into the people 's assembly for access to power,0
dialogs ai n't that bad,0
these characters seem awash in a sea of bad dialogue as they search in vain for a story,0
a terrible script and bad bad acting,0
the interactions within the cast were very good,0
maybe i was too young and dreamy when i watched this movie but my friends and i could not stop talking about this through high school years,0
it was heartbreaking disturbing and inspiring all in one,0
or what about daniel 's acting,0
4 for a cheesy horrorthriller it is really aesthetically pleasing,0
but at its heart the film is about two people a young french beauty bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver with bollywood aspirations from vastly different cultures their slowly growing attraction for each other and the beautiful mad chaos that is india today,0
i swear i had never seen such a bad movie as half caste is,0
what a rare and beautiful way to spend two hours,0
i ca n't tell much of the story without spoiling it so i 'll just say that it 's a high school comedy and yet it 's not,0
let 's hope there will be more to see from the people who made this movie,0
he only makes a movie once every couple of years so he should n't have disappointed everybody like that,0
the movie has the insight of office space while loosing none of the style of shawshank,0
i believe quentin tarantino managed once again to create a fantastic story,0
i did n't want to be disappointed,0
i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later,0
there are many reasonable people in the world who believe in id but do not want it to be taught in science class,0
then the gang find the woman who has the matchbox,0
the traces of it are so strong it must have just left the room and it 's almost as though if we hurried we could catch it,0
so good that someone claimed when the movie was on theaters that the scene with the fetus was a snuff,0
only older people and geeks should watch this movie,0
predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time,0
gene kelly has the least developed part in the movie,0
she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease,0
i cannot honestly say that the plot is any less hapless than several other horror movies you could pluck off of the shelves of your nearest rental store,0
so many in fact i could not keep track of what was in the movie that was not in the book and vice versa,0
secondly the irritating science teacher,0
the car chase does n't last long enough,0
this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry,0
we could n't finish the movie because we were so annoyed with the corny plot awful skinny role models and the dull argument that does n't teach you anything about adolescence because this movie is too happy sunny and colorful,0
this movie is a lock for a razzie,0
there 's also a gorilla kept in a cage who is used occasionally for heaven know 's what,0
we all know that movie psychos have immortal dna,0
they dealt with love and romance often unhappy romance from the woman 's point of view and had a strong female character in the leading role,0
what about his outfit in the film masterpiece he must have picked it himself,0
you wish that they will find each other,0
like any selfrespecting movie connoisseur i grabbed the remote intending to change the channel to any other paid advertisement that would have been more worth my time,0
the script is just a confusion of parts and after watching it again bogart seems to be playing second fiddle to lee j cobb,0
if this is called survival,0
browning 's sense of the macabre and the atmosphere of terror are all too ingrained in what we have left,0
i ca n't find anything good to say about this movie,0
maybe he 's difficult or something,0
basically the story goes like this,0
martin sheen is like a vase so weak and wimpy he does n't have the air befitting of a captain,0
aside from the fact that this was so obviously a low budget film with bad editing and good enough story,0
accomplished that with grace to spare,0
we are eagerly waiting for part 2,0
i do n't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men will and grace king of queens but ca n't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour,0
the children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river,0
overall the film is a clear miss and an example of why sequels got such a bad name back in the eighties,0
to make amends he takes up medicine becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it,0
this was a good game nice graphics and an interesting tale,0
unfortunately the writing was n't nearly as clever as the first and subsequently left mr firth with nothing to work with,0
watch out too for jimmy nail 's brief appearance his attempt at an american accent is so astoundingly rubbish it 's fantastic,0
now we know this movie is going to be really horrible,0
betty grable and dick haymes are in great voice,0
at the three quarters mark i had figured it out,0
i liked the plot but the execution was done horribly,0
some of its films seem quite modern while others seem very old,0
this short had some exceptional parts in it,0
you can tell they know the music and have a real love for what they 're doing but there 's no magic behind it,0
no one believes her claims that it was candyman who committed the crimes,0
having recently taken a class focusing in great detail on immediate postwar japan this film is a good reflection and comment on that time,0
i 've watched it 34 times and each time i appreciate it even more,0
the thing i like most about it are the questions,0
disney continues to firmly hold the title of greatest animation in the world with a bugs life standing as one of their greatest achievements,0
i watched it with my girlfriend and we were both amazed by the film,0
or was the booby trap set off after robin left the jail,0
i saw it last week and the sketch about the korea towns was funny,0
the film 's final image is so utterly absurd and pointless as to almost make it worth watching though,0
i 'll try to finish with a few positive aspects like for example it stars ken foree,0
as a jingle writer and producer joe knows this dynamic very well and as portrayed here it 's deadon the most accurate and honest part of the film,0
i'm sure the script was too ambitious considering the monetary means for this movie was obviously limited,0
he is intent on being elected mayor,0
but now 19 years later is truly an embarrassing movie for everyone concerned,0
this is one of the worst films i 've ever seen,0
the two take a journey and in the process ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and evie share,0
it is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930 's,0
if you are looking for a funny touching insightful feelgood movie then ten inch hero is for you,0
i always look forward to this movie when its on tv,0
the creature and its powers are farfetched but they work in this film,0
but god help me i know this is where i 'll lose you is n't that what it 's always been about,0
and the quality is sub par if that means anything,0
her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character,0
icet rob lowe mario van peebles the very strange burt reynolds ai n't a bad cast though they often look a bit confused,0
since i'm no better than the average north american on this issue i'm afraid that this is a lesson we 'll all have to learn the hard way,0
i like the end a lot,0
the scene plays like this,0
the script and direction was uninspired and cliche,0
there 's no character development whatsoever some very dodgy acting zero chemistry between the leads and worse still very little to like about them,0
the music is quite nice and the show is n't too bad altogether although the style is n't my favourite,0
i honestly went into this movie with an open,0
demi moore as marina is in earnest even though she gets off to a wrong start by marrying a man she thinks is the right one but her feelings are n't based on solid ground as it turns out,0
i truly did not care if she got her man or remained single and unhappy,0
none of the characters including his is developed very much,0
did n't realise she was the solicitor in the red dust,0
i kind of like jag,0
it 's hard to explain but see it and find out for yourself,0
this is a movie that completely lacks an ending especially if you were expecting something from what you 've read on the back,0
this film was beautifully photographed and its story was lyrical,0
you know it 's happening but the scene when his mom goes into his room and finds him dead in bed still ca n't help but put a few tears in your eyes,0
before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap,0
this is a laugh out loud farce,0
comparisons to the original series are inevitable,0
this is your typical lynch short,0
probably the only con in a movie with a lot of pros,0
i ca n't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending but suffice to say the origin of the monster and the method found to get rid of it just do n't hold water,0
so i was completely lost throughout the whole movie,0
i would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of lonesome dove but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all,0
it looks like anyone can make a film these days so grab your friends any object that has a camera and get to work,0
here in one heavenly night we 've got all the makings of a terrible old musical,0
the movie shows how sometimes what people see as different is in many ways better than what most people call normal,0
once again someone in hollywood dares to create something different,0
its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown,0

but if you want great rb music impossible stunts and a whole load of great laughs then you ca n't do too much better than blues brothers 2000,0
i was sitting in my sofa thinking what shall i do,0
the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk but also down not sound to be scripted,0
penn teller made it look like they had to pay money,0
there 's nothing special about it just cruelty,0
they try and fail a lot but you appreciate the merits of the attempt and recognize it for what it is,0
i just saw this on hbo in the us tonight,0
the teens actually act like teens and tommy oliver actually acts like a mentor or no a teacher,0
though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there,0
the state of qin is pronounced chin not shin a pity the researchers did n't get this right,0
advice do not pay money for this,0
his style of animation is very original,0
but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is,0
i think that 's what made me so angry the fact that they 've taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum,0
when cindy takes a job as the caretaker of an elderly woman she runs into some scary ghosts with a grudge,0
what horrible writing and acting,0
then she runs out to the plastic surgeon wanting a new face which will take 6 months to heal during which time she abandons the hot sweet as pie boy,0
the only difference with this movie is that it was poorly acted and heavily laden with a continual line of gay clichs that as a gay viewer myself i was embarrassed just watching it,0
it does not even matter that much what you are the one example of with a cool title like that,0
simply they did have a soul,0
a lot of the other cannibal flicks hailing from italy are n't masterpieces however and this is certainly the case with the green inferno aka,0
in plot line deadgirl owes a lot to river 's edge in that a group of teens without pity or any sense of decency abuse a corpse and refuse to divulge the information to anyone of authority,0
everyone stays true to their colors and it rolls toward a predictable conclusion,0
in particular the youngest person under water for three minutes,0
i accidentally watched it in 1998 the footage should be held and used by the police army medical services security services and forensic departments,0
audio was quite bad i had to raise it to about 78 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog,0
without them the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone including the director,0
there is also a great sense of humour to this film which may seem weird at times but always funny,0
of course the war arrived and the movie was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and to each other through the invasion as they were mistreated by the enemy and by their own government,0
i cannot believe anyone would finance such a pointless meaningless movie,0
so i was really surprised about this one,0
ash 's performance like any of her hindi movies was pathetic,0
the cinematography is just too perfect for my liking,0
and for who wonders i found the movie on a friend 's dvd containing other important stuff and only curiosity led me to the end of this movie,0
the mexican originals were weird enough to begin with american boundaries and accepted horror film conventions were cheerfully disregarded,0
good thing our parents were asleep the whole time,0
however the rampant stupidity actually undercuts that conventional wisdom,0
initial fears were realised when it was revealed that the film was set in the near future which stirred up bad memories of highlander ii,0
do n't pay for it wait for it on mystery theater 3000,0
the most curious aspect to a story such as this involving such unduly diverse characters a miserable recluse a zesty yet insecure waitress and a sensitive and insightful yet wronged homosexual is that in their distinct differences they share many of the same problems and these problems eventually bring them all together although hardly in a civilized manner,0
in fact the visual treats seem static uninspired and unoriginal,0
the acting is terrible i think but it 's hard to tell because the writing is so bad maybe there was just nothing they could do with it,0
that sounds like the opening scene of a softcore porn film and at first it seems that that is exactly what donkey punch is turning into,0
the lighting was poor to nonexistent and entire scenes were simply excised,0
suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience,0
perhaps this could help us not open our eyes but more so to lift our entire body for action,0
however i found myself rather enjoying this film for many reasons,0
how come none of these fine actors seem to shine in their parts,0
this film will be forgotten in a year or two,0
basic story that they covered in the episode frat house hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol death turns out to be senators son who wants fbi to investigate,0
we are being presented with two dramatically different views of how to value life 's experiences,0
he breaks the mirror of shakespeare 's verse into a thousand shards of two or three words each and then shouts the fragments in as disconnected and unintelligible manner as possible,0
but do n't say you were n't warned,0
i was mortified and i was not expecting rainman or willy wonka,0
grieco although aging was really fantastic and we all know how well a certain topless actress in this film maggie q has done since,0
slower but a more stable and resilient gun platform than the spitfire,0
the camera then gives us a closeup of the lizard 's face this is i assume the director 's way of showing us that the lizard is evil,0
as cooper 's friend and rival for the affection of hopkins march is also very funny which comes as no surprise after his brilliant parody of john barrymore in the royal family of broadway,0
i liked this movie because it deals with the great questions of life,0
what was the white light what impact has it had,0
of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die,0
i'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake as i was unable to watch all of it,0
if williams had stayed on for the duration of bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when pernell whitaker left the show,0
right my original interaction with this movie was last may when i was given a cd of various broadway songs one of them being the revival version of the song cabaret from cabaret of course so when a production of the show came to my city this last month i was eager to see such,0
the virtual reality date line despite being a bad idea to start with is used in the worst possible way in this film,0
this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender,0
the movie is n't funny badly paced boring a real stiff,0
halloween of course shows this in it 's most terrifying way,0
it 's in spain the moviemakers take women seriously,0
i do n't really understand this movie,0
changing into the beast one night he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted,0
sadly from what i have read this film might be a case of art imitating life as pavarotti 's own life later had some parallels to this film though this is n't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail,0
it 's not everyone 's brand of humor to be sure and has uproariously funny dark moments if you 're open to them,0
joke but it still works brilliantly due to matthau 's comic timing,0
after five bad sequels of a potentially likable franchise had passed i had hopes that somewhere along the line someone actually cared,0
the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement,0
maybe what is missing is,0
i think what i like most was that they made them specific and smart and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for beth 's bulimia,0
i would give this film an 8 out of 10,0
many people will never get the sarah silverman program but i'm glad i eventually came around,0
lynch 's new film inland empire is similar to his other work but unlike anything he 's ever done or i 've ever seen before,0
the action humor and wit this film contained easily made it one of my favorite films of all time,0
it 's downhill from there,0
his introduction you prop it explains ator 's origin to us with images of the first part,0
to call this movie a jaws ripoff is rather misleading in some ways,0
but do n't get me wrong this is definitely about women and not girls,0
and it 's so great to watch it flows so well it 's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience,0
any movie should have an idea simple or more complex it needs one the problem with fragata it 's once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasons they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind,0
george hilton portrays peter lynch,0
i have never been a fan of mol but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes,0
there 's no reason you would root for them to make it together,0
this is a highly recommended film for those who love acting period pieces or just if you want to see a really good film stage beauty is very much the film to watch,0
she should stick to guest appearances on sitcoms that require very little acting and even less camera exposure,0
it 's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness,0
i also find his are you a man or woman shows as extremely insulting,0
i enjoyed the show as a kid,0
most other films before and since stereotyped asian characters as clownish and comical to an absolutely racist degree,0
every walsh film i have seen never loses a beat of it 's pace he truly was a born filmmaker,0
what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that robbie was hopelessly addicted to a roleplaying game called mazes and monsters a game that he gets reacquainted with after a gaming group recruit him for a campaign,0
the newborn baby becomes separated from its mother and all hell breaks loose,0
swimmers is a lovely poetic movie about a young girl who needs an operation and the impact of the crisis on her family which does not have health insurance,0
everything about it is top notch,0
unfortunately the dvd transfer puts the film in full frame but one still gets the impression that the cinematographer knew what he was doing,0
most interesting to me is that of natalie and aaron and their attempts to escape europe,0
he insists that wing commander is the worst movie ever made so when i saw that scifi channel was going to air it this week i thought oh good,0
moriarty has had it with holmes now he has got him and his death must be a long one for holmes,0
i 'll give an example,0
doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them,0
given its considerable legacy the shadow deserved better treatment than this,0
i have always loved james garner in everything he does and it is a credit to his acting that i never think of him as james garner or rockford in this series and totally believe in him as kate 's dad,0
but it was n't the young boys that swore so that helped,0
ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune,0
a group of astronauts miraculously penetrate the rings of saturn without being crushed,0
i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end,0
what was with his lame clothes,0
although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half here he looks like a dying man,0
in the spirit of the classic the sting this movie hits where it truly hurts in the heart,0
all humans must see it at least once,0
she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile and if the rumours are to be believed she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence,0
at this point i find that maury and his producers are the most manipulative folks on this planet with that show,0
you might say it was for the sake of comedy but it was way overdone and inappropriately shown,0
burton and his wife annie study books about the aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions,0
colman and price plead their case before the judge played by cedric hardwicke,0
it touches on a topic that is everpresent in our daily lives but which is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not merit discussion,0
there are no tables present,0
the story is surely interesting and all actors have performed their part very well and with all the resources it had it was a sure formula for success,0
suraj 's direction is simple but effective,0
2 out of 10 kids,0
but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bs,0
the scene in which lemmon loses a tooth followed by losing his hearing followed by the ability to hear only every other word spoken is quietly hysterical,0
she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it,0
the dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable,0
in the desert mark meets daria and quickly falls in love,0
she inhabits a very public and very familiar setting in an underground tube train but shuns attention and dismisses claims from one passenger she is the successful author she is accused of being,0
i have to own that',0
erika eleniak is marginally engaging and corey feldman is well underused,0
spanish novel director jesus ponce creates one of the most perfect gallery from the latest year of spanish cinema,0
it was as if they picked him up right out of the 20s and dropped him modern day times,0
but with close encounters of the third kind i was hugely dismayed by how dull plodding predictable and outright stupid this film was,0
the fact that she made her own child say that she knew who killed jenny was one of the most horrible things i have ever seen,0
but they avoided doing that completely and instead made a film that 's real honest and touching yes but never overthetop,0
i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed,0
but i just want to say the people who really get the movie probably wont be affected by it in the way that the writer intended,0
inglorious basterds is a dark and violent comic fantasy gloriously so,0
i ca n't think of one positive thing to say about this film i really ca n't,0
the movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999 among his other outstanding credits are eyes wide shut 1999 full metal jacket 1987 barry lyndon 1975 a clockwork orange 1971 2001 a space odyssey 1968 spartacus 1960 and many more,0
and they vary from a story set totally in someones head playing chess with himself to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming,0
no doubt that this early talkie with some flaws or doubtful situations still partially conceals that behind the camera there is one of the masters of cinema frank capra,0
he awakens to find himself in an older mansion where a woman stephanie seems to know him despite the fact that he 's never seen her before and an older transvestite roberta is keeping paul and stephanie captive apparently with the intent of watching them have sex,0
it was just so refreshing to watch a movie where your imagination was free to soar rather than feel confused by the apparent deja vu from last year 's first installment of the same pointless drivel,0
as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute,0
three years later shearer is a glamorous and flirty divorce,0
i vaguely remember the trailers for long time dead and recall it did fairly poorly in cinema tickets and rental sales,0
the hate surrounding this film is extremely misguided,0
you have wonder about the wisdom of even attempting to convert a book which is powerful tribute to the power of words and language and turning into a wouldbe powerful tribute to gwyneth paltrow,0
a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in god 's hands,0
universal could have done better than this,0
joan is great as this woman unraveling at the seams,0
my only complaint is that i almost did n't want the film to end,0
he cried when 1 he told her he loved her 2 she got sick 3 chris klein came back and he saw how happy she was w him 4 she died,0
some of the score was actually good,0
you 'll probably like it,0
but there 's still a happy ending which befuddled me a bit,0
i thought that this was rude of shepard and i felt some unknown sympathy for nolte,0
shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow,0
i really dislike aline macmahon,0
we thought this could match the first,0
they do n't shock too much even though the film tries it very much,0
the story involves a creator a mythical land where good battles evil the good guys need the light,0
anyway the mechanik was fantastic,0
it 's not b series but z series,0
you wo n't even see any till about the very end and even then you wo n't get to fight them,0
ok ok i know there are some doris wishman fans out there who find this all part of her peculiar charm,0
let me start by saying that liev has gained a ton of respect from me after seeing his directorial debut everything is illuminated,0
the story arch if you can call it that largely consists of vaughn 's partner victor having a spiritual crisis and slowly turning over to the dark side,0
you will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual then you will get 105 minutes of fun,0
and yeah i know that can be funny sometimes but this was n't the kind of bunch i wanted to spend two hours with,0
the longest and best dbz film there is,0
casey investigates the nearby electricity plant,0
the story was wellwritten but not woody 's genius,0
but that might just be my naivety,0
the movie has great writing and great lines,0
however in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that dana is never nice,0
later though he begins to bond with the kids and discovers as does the kids that he actually really does care about them because he does n't want what happened to him to happen to them,0
going any further with the synopsis would compromise a lot of the film 's slow reveal about what 's happened to dave and andrew and how they deal with their new reality,0
it 's just a mess,0
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year,0
i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city,0
unfortunately for that almost good part of the film angelina jolie was cast as the main actress of original sin,0
anyway annie can dish it out as well as take it,0
i knew who charles nelson reilly was from the old game shows on tv when i was a kid,0
i did n't know what to expect from the film,0
here chase is the fugitive hiding in the garage of his first wife hawn unbeknownst to her second husband charles grodin,0
6 if you 're husband is a rapist just accept it 7 after you personally get raped befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible,0
well if you are as new to the bollywood phenomenon as i am you will be as confused by this movie as i was,0
because of war going on they have to close the circus,0
elvis has left the building,0
it contained the return of brian austin green,0
i liked every second of this film,0
the audience was silent and disinterested,0
i thought brody 's performance was extraordinary,0
oh and one more thing,0
films and most of them are just a bunch of great fights with little story this one is an exception,0
billy bob thornton astronaut farmer is brilliant in fact looking back the character is fairly similar in the fact he holds the family of pot growers together,0
it 's a daringly abstract premise,0
it 's definitely a tear jerker but one of the better films i 've seen in a little while in the theater,0
i wonder what would have happened to her if she 'd got a third scene,0
it had a lot of that handheld firstperson shaking camera which i love like rec cloverfield and blair witch project,0
stephen mcnally and james stewart have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic as duel in the sun 's blazing guns finale,0
also the acting is weak i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act,0
every minor detail adds to the whole experience,0
his face completely fills the screen as if the director is saying here you go,0
it deals with the attempted coverup by the local marine commander of unacceptable conduct by a marine major which resulted in his being shot to death by his former girl friend a marine captain,0
chaney deserves all the praise in the world for his portrayal of the tragic lenny,0
also the plot and story are not particularly involving or believable,0
this is an hilarious movie,0
perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys,0
the first film i saw from these people was children of the grave and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted,0
it never seems for me to find some obscure film from the uk or even here in america that places itself in a situation simple human nature,0
however despite this edge she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies,0
keane is a searing portrayal of mental illness,0
the other star in his own right is eddie rochester anderson,0
she learns that her own beloved father runs an international hard drugs network hallucinates about eerie maggots crawling around everywhere and eventually hooks up with another archaeologist that fancies etruscan tombs,0
it 's a wonderful film,0
first of all as chipping peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances,0
i you are used to watching hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed,0
i highly recommend this to people who prefer their humor on the cerebral side,0
the list goes on if you were to make a drinking game out of this you could call it cliche or maybe even crap movie,0
look out for cameos from david walliams and matt lucas of little britain and rock profile fame,0
dr john harvey kellogg was pretty much as depicted in this film a most excellent job by anthony hopkins,0
lots of sand riding across the sand people passing out in the sand and dying,0
this show is so much fun to watch,0
the rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes on which i will elaborate,0
they do crash an event and the guy says hi to her but is too overcome with her stardom to ask her out,0
they have no depth or dimensions or personalities,0
but sooner or later that intention will change this is truly one of the most moving movies ever as well as one of the most dark and disturbing actually i think i would tie this with american history x as equally disturbing and moving at the same time warning watch this movie at your own risk,0
i actually did n't like the whole werewolf costume but the special effects people made it look realistic and i liked it,0
for those of you who like these type of campy bad horror movies i'm going to break it down for you on a scale of one to ten death 9 gore 6 nudity 1 sex 0 unintentional humor 6 special fx 7 acting 4,0
yes the main character is stodgy and stuffy but that does n't mean the movie has to be,0
that would say a lot about hollywood and their disregard for anyone else,0
the director is so heavy handed at this that the audience just does n't care and is thoroughly bored by the same old routine,0
this is one of the most vapid poorly acted movies i have seen in years,0
before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg the theatre was more affordable to average people,0
the music was hip and matched the screens of the movie,0
laurel plays a scottish naive young person who arrives in america in full kilt,0
one major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 's tv screen to the 1990 's moviegoing public is our collective memory,0
again the film begins in mid stream with louis in his sixties coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness,0
i have nothing against the actress just the way some of the things she said were written or said,0
although it can be very tedious at times this movie is really not all that bad,0
it 's a movie that is made great by having an amazing cast making well written characters come to life and this is in big part because sandler and drew have amazing chemistry,0
the plot is simplistic and predictable the characters one dimensional and clichd,0
and then they put them all in,0
is this a good bad movie,0
but celeste has been hiding a deep dark secret and the arrival of lori and jeffrey might just bring it to the surface,0
i 've described this film as surprising this is true in many respects,0
you do n't actually see me because iam far off from the scene,0
please please please read the gorgeous novel in spanish if possible,0
lewis and drew arrive unseen and lewis being a fair archer kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest,0
her reaction is not immediate and she simply replies i do n't know i love you with it but i 've never known you without it,0
this is an excellent movie,0
if no one has seen the movies,0
i had to walk by some woods in the dark on the way home from this movie and i was quite convinced that one of these guys was going to stroll out from among the trees and break me in half just as the first creature karl 'killer davis did to his gangster victim in the opening scene,0
bob hope 's first credited film is a delight,0
i thought this was an interesting idea that had potential,0
maria comes from an abusive household and seeks to get away,0
when i started watching it i hated it for the first 30 minutes i paused the movie and thought about it any movie that makes us think must be a great achievement,0
there are four or five cartoon animations that do nothing to continue the story,0
then i thought i was watching an episode of friends,0
ellen will you please stop being a woman,0
scott glenn who 's an exconvict is working at gilley 's and this film was his breakout role,0
the ending is so syrupy you 'll wish you had some pancakes to go with the syrup,0
i feel like calling blockbuster to complain that they actually carried this film in their store,0
the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes,0
i had zero idea why any girl would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris,0
it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason,0
i just think the script had potential but the execution turned it into a clich and an awful one at that,0
it 's because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al gore 's documentary,0
then it 's just plain hilarious,0
i saw this movie several times as it 's a classic we can see quite often on tv,0
during this chase to find it the monster is scouring streets targeting citizens feasting on flesh retreating to the sewers periodically to escape from harm,0
in the first film jane seemed like a walking contradiction like the writers back then just did n't know how to portray a character like that,0
regrettably i recommended this film to a teacher when it played last week at the seattle international film festival,0
well meryl is worried about losing her man but she 's much more upset because goldie looks so much better than her,0
let 's see how to begin a rich handsome outgoing cuban businessman intentionally decides to screw up his life,0
not for fans like me,0
apart from that the film was a very pleasant surprise,0
arly jover is very otherworldly and deadly,0
tho the essence of the source such as obsessions loneliness and to endure love exist in the film it does have a number of significant changes,0
i could n't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters,0
the ending of this film is really what pulled it together for me,0
they are immediately seen as the enemy to our main characters too,0
it relies on mood and suspense and that works so much better,0
now i do have my complaints,0
i could n't help but think of all the times i 've heard psychic sylvia brown on tv saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say look you 're dead,0
the rest of the acting if i can call it that was quite forgettable,0
at the end of the film after having created a deep bond through knowledge of each other beyond only sexual knowledge both the physical and emotional planes are almost familial in nature,0
now with all that said i would really like to be able to rate this a perfect 10 or at least just under like the first four episodes,0
so here 's what i guess you 'd call the plot there are some poachers in a very foggy forest,0
this is a well made beautiful film about the kidnap and torture of women,0
also hwang jang lee does n't get to do much of his trademark awesome leg work nor is his character up to the standards of the thoroughly mean folks he has played in the past,0
even though marisa tomei broke through and won best supporting actress at the academy awards for her performance an award she earned and much deserved i still say underrated,0
the acting did n't work little really worked right in this film,0
a lot of things happen but because we do n't know the characters,0
linnea quigley is in it after all and that helps,0
check out his ridiculous accent and the dumb speech,0
if you 're a glutton for punishment then do n't let me stop you,0
wrong this movie held my interest from start to finish,0
with the exception of a few sporadic and impressive performances there is nothing american gun really offers,0
worse still there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors,0
showing osama bin laden as a funny screwed guy,0
it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this,0
even there 's no sign of sex in chang 's story,0
this suggests that in reality 'normal' people are just as immoral and wrong as open criminals like alex and his gang,0
the biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of storylines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies,0
the script remains fairly faithful to the book and the costumes and scenery give a very convincing victorian look,0
if you liked mystic river reservoir dogs goodfellas godfather i ii and various cop robber shows on tv over the past 50 plus years you 'll love seeing this realistic portrayal of a little selfdestructive crime family that could be operating in any ethnic neighborhood in any larger city at anytime in history,0
lou diamond phillips did a much better job in attempting to speak navajo,0
you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it,0
if you are n't a teenager with bad taste or simply do n't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film,0
disney 's watered down version still taught that lesson sort of,0
bad bad not in the fun cheesy b variety movie,0
every line spoken was either witty charming or something you 'd expect to hear in everyday conversation,0
i would n't watch this show if i were you it 's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon,0
sure it has lost some of it 's flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but that 's not why you should like it,0
well the bottom line is that for cary grant he made a few other comedies that were better,0
one of them decides to pull on his jogging shoes and run for help,0
naturally she has waited until he is adult before taking her pursuit onto dry land but the implication is selfevident,0
its refreshing especially considering today 's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas to see a film with a convinced political voice unafraid to force the audience to consider its viewpoint,0
respectively collette and cumming create characters who are very real people and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film,0
while i do feel this film is tedious at times it is a very interesting film and perhaps much deeper than people imagine,0
in a nutshell my favorite actor in this film was eva marie saint who indeed gave a saint of a performance the scene of her talking to her husband in the hospital spilling her guts what happened to us max,0
kind of like seeing this movie,0
starbuck is a train wreck and seems to be eternally heading for her comeuppance but never seems to get it,0
the big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and charlie chaplin was no exception,0
once the first year of classes gets going the film settles into a nice groove,0
anthony hopkins and richard dreyfuss perform well though,0
i 'd rather watch the paint dry,0
it 's a fictional story yet has more real answers,0
during practically the whole film we are in doubt if sgt,0
the movie concentrated on the conflicts that lead almost to the destruction of their marriage,0
it came out when the slasher era was about to end,0
and then i think this movie ended,0
a settlement which in it 's own right is an illegal venture in native territory be prepared for some really bad things to happen,0
mary steenburgen is great as mary gulliver,0
the first story was n't very original but it was fun none the less,0
and they 're sitting there in the trunk and he says what a view she says what makes it a view,0
and its a very good actor so it deserves that and more,0
unfortunately the snowman comes with him,0
perhaps it is n't but even than this could have been a good movie but it sure is n't and i 'll explain you why,0
as far as the red dress being more visible in sharp contrast with the white costumes of the other young women at the ball the black and white effect is more dramatic,0
but it has so my only advice is to steer clear,0
there is an unlimited supply of breasts many of them bare in an vain attempt to distract from the plot holes,0
to me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas,0
i recommend you to skip it,0
absolute waste of time watching it,0
my decision may be biased due to the fact that i believe in aliens,0
but it is an enjoyable film and sean connery is always fun to watch,0
saw this film when it came out more than a quarter century ago,0
the best most stylish thing about omen iv the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path 's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything,0
god i just could n't believe people could make such bad movies,0
however try as he might he never wrote a monumental dramatic masterpiece,0
the movie contains some very good acting and some excellent scenes and dialogue,0
and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect which has happened at least the offer was made,0
in this newest animated movie there 's a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether she 's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance,0
gage not only manages to save her but arrests hendricks as well,0
i recommend it as a mindless alternative to prime time network tv or as a late night cap,0
this movie destroyed anything positive i felt for the nightmare series,0
director asher was better in the half hour television format,0
all the family arrive for dinner to be held at night,0
steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life the frustration and sincere compassion,0
the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neonazis will act like violent neonazis,0
we see keane 's life with all it 's ugly and often selfdestructive details that include drug use violence and anonymous sex,0
this last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending,0
but has anyone ever thought of racing cars while in prison,0
now there is a reason to give this film a second look,0
his girlfriend has other ideas and wants him to go to the police,0
anybody could make a machine destroy it blame his neighbor for making him destroy it and then go into a 40 year rage about how it was the best invention since the beginning of time and they were robbed but people would think he 's a fool,0
do n't waste your time,0
and finally neal mcdonough as m bison let me repeat that neal mcdonough as m,0
they are real people dedicated to a great endeavour,0
this one is a shame,0
the final thirty minutes or so are pure gripping impressive war genre cinema,0
for a while i made a habit of watching lousy movies including battlefield earth delta force commando and starship,0
i had to wake up the people i was watching it with several times,0
one of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth,0
at least you will get a decent laugh,0
just get into he story already,0
once again many thanks for your review,0
hey you are not alone,0
you 've seen worse movies,0
it does n't work period,0
the final story regards a writer with a twisted past,0
talk about clever and unexpected dialogue,0
i do n't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly,0
it would surely be a hell of a lot less painful than watching this rancid mass of decay again,0
do not under any circumstances miss this,0
this is modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her backstory it 's accurate,0
the script is so full of holes i ca n't see how the producers agreed to finance it,0
with a sure hand logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story,0
the rest of the movie followed through accordingly,0
it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story,0
as it stands someone screwed up huge,0
2 like the goats man its good for inflicting on your unsuspecting friends,0
if you 're hoping for battle scenes reminiscent of braveheart forget it,0
if you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to watch,0
but the real hit of the show is let 's face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show,0
too many questions are left open,0
however next time please take some additional time to conduct the proper research on proper wear of navy uniforms,0
no hiding here from anything,0
you rent these films for a bit of sauce and unpc fun you do n't really expect to be so bored by it all,0
the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and that 's just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun,0
the film is a real light one but i found it very funny,0
cut is a harrowing piece of cult cinema that only confirms that chanwook park is a brilliant director,0
this is the best french movie of the year,0
the film has wicked british wit and has heavy surrealistic aspects to its production,0
trust your instinct and never watch or mention this film because it does not deserve any recognition,0
on the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive cross her and you 've run out of luck,0
in this case it was on the director and the writer,0
a big upset all around but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie,0
many have cited as possible reasons the director 's difficulties with the us authorities but equally it must be said this is difficult territory,0
the competition starts to heat up and they get the surprise they 'll never forget,0
they are not reclusive intellectuals either,0
from this relationship he went on to more slow slow meetings with other ladies,0
in this case the contrast between alicia 's rage and deanna 's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat,0
that 's the only logical explanation,0
i'm not familiar with the works of charles bukowski on which this film is based but still it 's rather interesting if strange,0
she 's very active and wellliked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years she 's not ready to move on,0
simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this is a good movie,0
so i married an axe murderer is one of the funniest yet scary romantic comedies of 1993 mike myers also plays the role of stuart mackenzie charlie 's father,0
when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it,0
all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva longoria 's cleavage,0
she deals with problems the way any human does with determination a little thought and weary disdain,0
also i 've heard that pudding is n't good for dogs ya,0
now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge,0
the nostril picker is indeed a unique film unique in it 's awfulness incompetence,0
i'm sorry for the director but even me as a humble spectator i'm able to see that it 's a bad movie with bad acting so how is it possible that the rest of the crew did n't reach the same conclusion,0
of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director,0
i'm not sure how many words the imdb allows viewers to prattle on in their reviews but whatever that word limit is it is not enough by 110th to adequately describe the awfulness that is al adamson 's dracula vs,0
the art direction is of a totally different style then ninja scroll and resurrection is only an hour long if that,0
the violence in the scenes are not justified and the story is very poor,0
but they also wanted to make a movie that would be appreciated by more wholesome folks by simply reediting the nude scenes out and voila a movie that can be played on some family network,0
she does well with what she 's got however and the lead duo 's chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she 's in,0
a lust for information that is never appropriately granted,0
i want that person to be my makeup person over the next 25 years so i 'll never age a day either,0
to say more would spoil some of the jokes so you must see it for yourself,0
it 's all just so cute all even the way that white bear loves the queen in secret and gets her in the end also the achievement the two young actors of gerda and kai gave,0
if you try and apply any logic or reason to the film you 'll find yourself being frustrated,0
this movie was the first and best of peter ustinov 's performances as hercule poirot,0
i saw the extended dvd version,0
i would have to say i never saw this either,0
the killer knocks slices people 's throats without anyone really noticing,0
a shootout between the graham 's forces and jessie lee 's leaves the colonel blind in one eye and his forces retreat,0
crazy like a fox is a deeply flawed film that nonetheless has its merits,0
not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending,0
i think my favorite bear was tanner because the role could have been over done but the kid did it just right not to mention his last line of the film is just classic and fit the movie just right,0
i wish her good luck elsewhere in other projects,0
unfortunately the former is given the short end of the stick in this irritatingly static production which spends an undue amount of time indoors,0
at times irritating but does have its elements of suspense and fright,0
then we meet an elderly man,0
the most noteworthy aspect of his direction is the treatment he bestows on the story,0
i freely admit i feel a touch of anger when reflecting upon ghosts of mars,0
i keep finding myself liking french action movies more than hollywood films,0
there are some splendid moments however which are pure visual fun as when harold attempts to follow a convertible down a crowded street or when he desperately tries to keep a nightclub stripper from losing her clothes,0
on the contrary i felt that it was fair and balanced even though concluding text before the credits indicates that the filmmakers probably did n't approve of the governorgeneral 's decision to dismiss the whitlam government,0
now this is n't to say that it 's a bad filmit certainly is n't,0
i rate this on the same level as jaws iv the revenge and everybody wins 2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame,0
and apart from that one bunch of farmers where are the people,0
a wonderful story that should be seen by all families,0
it may not have won the best picture oscar but most importantly won the people 's hearts,0
if you find a source let us know,0
and that 's why he is stronger,0
seeking gas and a place to warm up from the cold the teens knock on the wrong door of a deserted looking farm house that does have one sole occupant that has a big ass ax to grind,0
but see without you i'm nothing with a friend in the know because it 's definitely funnier that way,0
the characters are unlikeable the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic and the pacing is terrible,0
of the many groups it is the smaller ones which are able to keep themselves avoided by trouble most of the times as the larger ones are busy in conflict with one another,0
while it still holds up as an adult i was fortunate to have learned from it many times over years ago,0
it is also interesting to get a listen to some of the other musicians of brazil in some of the soundtrack,0
susana replies with a no,0
rebel is a blind drag racer who nearly runs down the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he is not using any headlights,0
in other hands this would have been a minor movie but in the hands of the two principals it was to say the least delightful,0
this was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background,0
it 's absolutely unique in my experience,0
on the other hand makeup costume lighting cinematography editing and directing were excellent,0
the monastery life is not the only expression of christianity but it is a significant one,0
if you 're going to see a bad movie at least see one you can laugh at,0
not only is this just a dire film by itself it did n't need another sequel because the last two had already been terrible enough,0
and the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part,0
but once i watched the episodes explaining who and what he is and what he did everything made sense,0
he escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted,0
there 's some decent early scenes in the trial but then the proceedings erupt into anarchy and more hammy acting,0
of course harper has a number of other people who loved her equally as much,0
still having come back to it after so long i was expecting to be greatly disappointed but actually i enjoyed it for what it is as a scifi epic it certainly brought nothing new to the table but was nonetheless fairly engaging with a stylish enough look courtesy of cinematographer billy williams and production designer stuart craig and thankfully did not overstay its welcome,0
want to see a brilliant aussie movie with non stop action feeling and a sense of awe and wonder watch gabriel made only four years later with much less money and a lot more soul literally,0
for my part i found any ethnic connection being carried over into the story very unconvincing in both the book and this film both of which come off as second rate,0
i was actually one of the makeup fx artists that help create the beast for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing,0
beats the hell out of me,0
nobody knew who blade was until marvel came out with that movie and it spawned into 3 movies because of it 's success,0
what would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance,0
it could have been better,0
her whiny it 's all about me performance often grated my nerves i know that was the point but still,0
lewis fared no better than in jaguar lives,0
but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash that is the funniest episode,0
with two people who are n't really known for there wrestling they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages,0
unfortunately from the earth to the moon is simply not in the same league as these examples,0
the killer named jonah is very colorless uninteresting persona and he definitely lacks the charisma to become a new legendary icon to follow up jason voorhees and michael myers,0
do yourself a favor and just skip it,0
i can only handle hearing ian mcshane bellow you are the seeker so many times,0
the first watch i hated this sequel but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more and though the jokes and plot are n't as strong as its predecessor bogus journey has enough feel good motives jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film,0
the readings are beautifully done,0
although the coopers really are sweet,0
as if any selfrespecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch,0
shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to,0
lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters,0
we 're not just talking about little things here either we 're talking about key plot points,0
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad,0
i sincerely hope david has not been singles out for his honesty,0
the plot was pretty much a run of the mill last house on the left ripoff,0
by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories how it felt and what they thought you get the feeling of having been there,0
the dvd is over 5 hours long with extras,0
they flirt the son is repelled but he gets some beer and comes back they walk around the project at night through gang members selling drugs,0
the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production,0
i would recommend this film to those who know how to read beyond the images,0
the american scenes are poorly done because it is fairly obvious that the producers have never been to america,0
and of course the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous because we are so narrowminded,0
in spite of a few truly charming scenes during a live broadcast gone awry this is trite uneventful and surprisingly pretentious arthouse filler,0
life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this,0
some scenes are not nice or beautiful but the camera never peeks or intrudes,0
they were shocked that doctors nurses the hospital institution were being mocked,0
it was just as predictable as i feared,0
first there 's josh friedman 's dialog she looks like that dead girl,0
it was done superbly with an absolute minimum of phony dramatics,0
the story only deals with an interpretation of the first part of jonathan swift 's classic story gulliver 's travels,0
that 's what many people originally thought about the comedy classic red dwarf when the idea was first brought up in the mid 80 's,0
and i really loved it,0
that 's as close as i get describing the plot but there 's a good chance i'm way off more important here is the atmosphere,0
so look across the controversy,0
if you like a myriad of emotions within a movie then i would definitely recommend this one,0
subtle and slow paced intriguing and pleasurable kpax is truly a gem to watch one of the kind movie that may not be for all tastes but those who see it might fall in love with it,0
lines like i like girls dumb but you 're pushing it,0
michaels video for smooth criminal which is absolutely fantastic with its dance sequences etc,0
anyways what i mean to say is that this movie is ridiculous,0
released to dvd 3 months later,0
his direction is heavily stylized but appears nearly accidental,0
this does n't really make sense and does n't work,0
the climax appeared in the pizza restaurant,0
horrifyingly enough i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to,0
there was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts,0
maybe it was just the charismatic presence of fenech or the brutal character played by pani but i could n't take my eyes off the television,0
this episode is slightly too long but the comedic acting keeps your interest,0
i saw it on the shelf and had looked at it before but never had the guts to rent it,0
i do n't think anyone could be happy with this sequel,0
though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour of it 's runtime i enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies such as the former army sergeant a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll a lovable manchild and a loony nymph,0
i think the woman that turned out to be a man in the end was a parody of a movie directed by the director of plan 9 from outer space and i knew the three stooges,0
this cheap pos is unbelievably bad,0
the narrative keeps changing pov for no good reason,0
one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right,0
newspaper reporter and that mr president,0
victor mclaglen portrays the fallen gypo nolan and definitely deserved the best actor oscar he was awarded for this film,0
believe it or not this is me at my most humanistic,0
mccoy does seem to win this round in his and spock 's evergrowing debate on the emotion over pure logic question,0
i guess the fact that things are rarely literally represented in his later movies also contributes towards this making everything more symbolic and hence universal,0
unfortunately my mom 's new boyfriend falls way below the grade and fails even at being mildly amusing,0
at the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you 're upset about the end,0
i really liked this film for what it is,0
some entertaining despite obvious flaws night of the bloody apes,0
while his characters emerge as largely onedimensional stick figures the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions,0
i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe,0
in spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well,0
the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort though the story feels a little flat,0
besides i 've never heard of the guy so who needs his attention,0
about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names,0
it 's as if the director is desperately trying to emulate the emotional power of scenes in blade runner by using that film 's same tricks slow motion sappy music and rain,0
john wayne pulled from obscurity for his first important movie role looks impossibly young but he immediately impresses with the natural charm masculine authority he brings to the hero 's role he quietly dominates the film with the attributes which would someday make him a huge star,0
the fencing scenes were thoroughly enjoyable,0
he looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie,0
during several battles he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce,0
karen finds it heartbreaking having to live away from her kids and streep really shows us not just how difficult that part of her life was but how difficult her entire life was,0
it is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast,0
but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism,0
this leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic,0
the mannequins in this movie are scary to begin with some with moving eyeballs some with no eyes at all and some with dropping mouths that sing too,0
the cinematography is nothing spectacular but it 's clearly done by professionals and i had no problem with the special effects,0
the exhibits include the werewolf a vampire the marquis de sade and an alien that is n't really explored,0
regardless of whether he 's masquerading as a ship 's cook a fire fighter or an la cop wearing love beads seagal is always seagal which is exactly what his fans want,0
truly one of the worst movies ever made,0
there are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers please do n't bother with this one,0
one day after awakening form a nightmare in a mall she is confronted by a detective who asks her odd questions about her childhood and after losing him she finds that that strange things begin to manifest such as the mall turning into a rusty ugly place filled with demons and what not and after escaping she bumps into a crazy lady that claims that she has being looking for her for a long time,0
for viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three,0
but still i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then,0
invariably this father knows best,0
freddy is no longer creepy his dream world makes just one noticeable appearance his real world powers make no sense and his choice of killing methods lack even a hint of imagination,0
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie,0
if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can,0
to say briefly world is about people on the planet earth about the complicated interactions of the ways of their dismal lives about constant incomprehensible feeling of sadness which covers our planet soaked within its thin layer of atmosphere,0
throughout the film it shows in the late 1930s jewish citizens being taken away by the army or secret police,0
how many films have you seen that convincingly made you put yourself into a street person 's shoes and think about your attitudes towards them,0
for the most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he 's in love with anne as surely he 's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive,0
i was somewhat amazed that only 4 people turned up to watch it guess the rest knew something we did n't,0
i 've seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented,0
after he is blown to body parts it seems that the maniacal jason is finally dead,0
to end this rant how would all of you feel if i made a movie and george washington looked like brad pitt and he lived and was n't the president and whatever,0
paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her,0
i was struck at the time by hugh grant 's hilarious portrayal of the twit of an englishman,0
or the lights going out mysteriously in the evening as our 'heroes' unwisely separate to tackle the problem,0
given the fate of amy 's turtle randolph it is no surprise that ferdin grew up to be a hardcore animal rights activist,0
i'm an avid dog lover which is one reason i had to see this movie,0
billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver,0
it is n't worth it,0
yet you ca n't help liking this show which is a constant reminder of our culture,0
forget about all of that this film er home movie is utterly horrendous,0
eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended,0
if his intention was to make the audience happy he failed,0
as you watch the survivors struggle to stay alive you long to see who lives and how they survive these unknown creatures that have taken over this planet,0
i watched the series when it first appeared on tv back in 1976 a vcr and a dvdplayer were unknown back then and i always hoped that one day i could have the movie in my possession,0
what john and paul said,0
let the empty acre bring itself to you,0
let 's just say highlander 2 is a masterpiece compared to this exactly,0
in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess,0
the wolf does n't kill the lamb even though each night he says maybe i 'll eat you tomorrow,0
i rolled on the floor in agony,0
that 's where i had to stop,0
soon he finds kirby has killed the drunken sheriff,0
i really thought she was a grosse pointe convenience store employee,0
this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced,0
of all the jack ryan films i think patriot games and it 's sequel clear and present danger remain the best in terms of storyline character development and overall direction,0
this is probably my favorite african american on screen couple of all time,0
do n't rent it do n't watch it do n't even say that it looks interesting,0
his muscles thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own conan the terminator and of course this one,0
the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot,0
it 's a nice gesture although one ca n't help but think it would have only really made a difference 40 years ago,0
all in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme but not one of bunuel 's best even though it was his last at age 77,0
and the weird ending featuring freddy krueger 's hand was a little far out there,0
some voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said out came the movie i could n't take it any longer can i sue for a hour of my life,0
as the film begins they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years they are going to relax and stop running,0
my dinner with andre is a rewarding film that was far ahead of its time in not just style but topics and social commentary,0
ps the movie was touted as 35 people under one roof believe it or not i counted the number of people in the house and they never reached 35,0
in sorority house massacre ii he used lengthy unrelated scenes from slumber party massacre as backstory to shm ii,0
when the indian that rj was jailed with supposedly confesses to the murder rj believes he was framed and when the indian is found hanged in his cell rj and alyssa decide to dig deeper though alyssa is less than impressed with rj 's behaviour to this point,0
dear god where do i begin,0
in this film josie the mother was locked in the house while her master and his family were on long vacation,0
it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you,0
either way they all stunk,0
all in all big bad wolf moved along at a good pace was interesting if nothing new or special and had a good conclusion,0
these writers must have been hard up for excitement,0
this concert footage for me is one of their best,0
it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets are terribly well done,0
she does not know how to dream she was never told that her life belonged to her,0
still these two women most especially know what 's funny and they know how to write a funny movie,0
only bridges and the ever reliable wendell corey seem to rise above the cast a bit but even they can only do so much,0
in viewing this movie you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version,0
bruno mattei known for many exploitation gems of low quality but high entertainment unleashes probably as good a cannibal movie you could put out today,0
it had its moments but overall when i watched this cartoon as a child i was bored out of my mind,0
walter woolf king della lind are in good voice as the composer his wife and their songs are pleasant if unremarkable,0
but it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your lifeand want to reaffirm the ones that continue,0
the other characters from the family are confusing,0
that at least was funny,0
cons not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix together,0
i do what i do because i am forced to by circumstances beyond my control,0
i'm sure they thought everyone would love a movie about people like them,0
the only drawback is the plot he gets mixed up with dead eye dan who then escapes but does n't reappear even when some more gangsters get involved later on,0
this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students,0
also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film,0
it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any gray matters will agree that this movie just does n't work,0
fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the soviet bureaucracy,0
however her screams soon turn to be gentle with me big guy and another giant ape and hot babe romance is born,0
fonda appears bored while still trying to appear smart and glamorous in her role,0
a show like surface is interesting,0
i collect vampire movies all of them,0
just as the film was going into production fields' original screenplay entitled playing the sticks was found to be somewhat jumbled and too brief to sustain a featurelength movie,0
what appeared clever in the written page does n't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera,0
this is comic perfection from beginning to end and not even the dismal dislikable annoying diane keaton could hurt it,0
this movie could have been made by a 12 year old boy and other teenage boys who refuse to grow up,0
jim harper calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography wellconstructed shots and exceptionally violent murders,0
after playing this game you 'll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at jacko 's killer moves,0
it is probably one of her greatest films ever,0
it 's pure delight and fun,0
we rented the dvd and then he saved his own money to buy it,0
but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation,0
first off kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role,0
cops sometimes do that sort of thing,0
as if that were n't enough the entire movie relies on constant voice over narration,0
do n't even bother watching this film as a rental folks its not worth it and you will regret spending your hard earned on this garbage,0
try to understand he does n't care,0
i would say that this was inspired by the success of willard which came out the previous year but the action is provided by spiders instead of rats,0
i could blast this movie for its corny 1950 songs dances romances and characters but that was the '50s and a lot of people liked this sort of things,0
the physical types fit for as far as i can tell every single character,0
the only scene which really made me cringe was when hale falls off the back of the truck he then picks himself up runs after it catches it up jumps on the back,0
that tells me that someone thought the original was worth redoing someone thought this version was better and the original must 've been worse,0
many artists record live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking so the final product is far from what the actual concert really was,0
luke and leia are not related,0
part one which details the initial struggle of the revolution of cuba is less about guevara and more about his cause under the leadership of fidel castro,0
to top it off the plot is pretty stupid,0
to see how they took a fairly simple story yet complex in its substance and dialogue and made it work so well i think any viewer will be amazed,0
in order to keep herself from becoming like her sister she must inject herself daily with monkshood,0
the acting is far from convincing there are some decently choreographed but poorly executed fighting scenes to be found and a very unlikely scenario sketched to force a reason for this movie that follows up on a series that well is already pretty much done and finished,0
we are all happy that the geek finally got the dream girl and that he beat up the jock and the dream girl realized how great a guy the geek was and then all of a sudden the geek wakes up and the whole crazy plot we watched was just a dream it did n't happen,0
really it seems harmless but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders live alone in seattle when they 're only 14 with an irresponsible moron and give out personal information is just wrong,0
someone earlier said that it was a sleeper,0
instead not only did i fail to laugh a single time i actually groaned in disbelief on several occasions,0
what child does n't appeal to this character,0
i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences,0
dont waste your time you will only be disappointed,0
the show is at least partially faked which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a fake episode,0
then the young family vanishes julia and steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends and nobody chases them,0
her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end,0
his scenes are the most entertaining to watch,0
this movie has all the elements of what a farce comedy should be,0
most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a moviethe rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were terrible,0
she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago,0
add this to your collection as well it will stay with you for sure,0
bates is a miracle she is perfect just like a role,0
having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago i can say that there is little if anything from the original book,0
for about 5 minutes that is,0
his boredom eventually leads him to watch his neighbors and make observations about them,0
a local tv station at that time late 1980s was trying to have it blocked for some reason,0
dry cleaners scene is legendary,0
i give it 7 stars out of 10,0
i was a diehard jag fan,0
the police ca n't find any other suspects and father tyrone is in trouble,0
they raise 3 children as miles' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment,0
some of the monster effects are done with stop motion animation and some with a man in a monster suit and each works okay on it 's own but there is no continuity between the two,0
if you like the excitement of a good submarine drama and the fun of a good comedy then this film comes highly recommended,0
sadly weakest side is actors' play,0
have n't seen the film since first released but it was memorable,0
you care enough to actually look up this movie which most people have forgotten about and then cared to read beyond the first review,0
the characters do n't do much to support this attempt at deepness and the acting is lousy all around,0
one did not need it anyway,0
and as a consequence his part as lloyd hopkins in this film is well suited crafted for woods' considerable depth,0
like that of rio bravo with dean martin and ricky nelson hellman chooses two individuals out of there element in selecting dennis wilson and james taylor,0
this is not a film to be taken seriously,0
interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a latenight bar,0
cgi was poor i could do a better job using ms paint directing poor too and at the end i did n't care about 1 character at all,0
4 out of 4 stars baby,0
i can describe that night exactly,0
during your adventure you will encounter 3d fighting sections 1st person shooting areas and concerts by david bowie himself in seedy nightclubs,0
unlike other commentaries i found this film fascinating even with all its faults and the zombie acting of some of the actors,0
or the duchess taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself,0
the film opens with the extended and compelling trial of a young girl accused of witchcraft leading to her relentless execution burning at the stake,0
so why in the name of all things good and innocent would the movies writers directors and producers immediately take away his blanket and thrust it into the hands of an evil person who towers over the muppets,0
however it is lite viewing and it has some excellent and charming scenes,0
the radio show was a super propaganda radio program,0
the story clearly shows that there is no absolution for seita,0
he becomes a sort of leader with some tv experience and we never ask why,0
i had seen no movie where you could find so few differences between the comic and the film,0
motion pictures are works of art that stick with you forever,0
so do me a favor and never watch this show,0
iron maiden are the absolute best when it comes to performing live and this dvd proves it,0
when a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors one has to question his motives in doing so,0
being someone who is in love with cinematography and has a decent surround system to enjoy good audio this documentary intrigued me,0
i say watch the movie with every notion and every expectation that you bring to any movie you see it only makes the movie that much more meaningful,0
they could have rebelled before now,0
although drowning out the dialog may have been a good thing since the dialog itself was dull and repetitive,0
seriously i suggest you stay away from this film it 's really stupid and pointless,0
the acting from the first frame was unconvincing and amateur and proceeded throughout,0
i worked in a supermarket for a long time and this stuff really happens,0
this film stinks plain and simple,0
the direction was confusing in its absence and the editing seems to have been done ten minutes before the premier,0
it is this backward shift of gears that forces a discovery of character revelation which goes beyond a simple childhood love of film,0
the love interest seems like a crazed lunatic bursting out in wild gestures,0
i give soldier 12 out of,0
i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector,0
rather it 's merely a featurette that 's an extra on the dvd of the movie the one it also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it 's listed here as,0
an all around excellent movie,0
without the glitter and the glamor of a hollywood flick it tells the heartwarming story of a young boy from a poor family trying to arrange the burial for his grandmother,0
after all that roy finally meets the running boy who 's name is mullet fingers well actually his nickname his stepsister beatrice gave it to him because he can catch mullets with his bare hands,0
sex scene after explicit sex scene makes it more like porn that art,0
it explores relationships especially the abusive ones has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting,0
every single line was over the top overly dramatic and just so plain ridiculously delivered it made me wonder if i was watching an ed wood film,0
she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability however which is important for this role,0
the dog is the best in this movie as well,0
this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad 50 's scifi to 2001 what we end up with though is just a slightly updated version of an old 50 's scifi cmovie,0
i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks,0
i mean wow just wow,0
italy is known for some for some very surreal and even whacked out horror films that have found success abroad,0
the bridge has already attracted a considerable fanbase and plaudits from home and abroad,0
one 6 minute sequence of a totally implausible rescue during a storm at sea earned an oscar nom for special effects must have been a very sparse year in this category,0
someone once asked me whats the inhabitants of the isle of mute called mutants,0
so anything short of a remake i fear would not bring this film back to life,0
the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly,0
and i feel like weeping here is the story about a woman who has been failed by everybody she has come in to contact with,0
the only people who actually think this are people who have n't watched any movies or read any books recently because we 're already doing a dead man 's float in crap,0
just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money,0
when clockwatchers was over i actually found myself depressed and menaced by the possibility that my life could turn out like the characters',0
do not rent this unless you are curious to see just how bad it is,0
2 if you have a car in per and you want to be a taxi driver just post a sticker with the word taxi on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets,0
one minute action the next pure comedy,0
i also enjoyed the scenes with the lads trying to earn money as construction workers,0
this is one shoddy piece of work,0
also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if i'm not mistaken joey wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch,0
this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name,0
and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and did n't serve a purpose,0
and this film is good for only that,0
you could see where with talented writers and editors with eyes in sockets this could 've been a decent film,0
and i'm a big zappa fan,0
one have to pay the rent i suppose,0
as is clear from the first frame onward tobe hooper 's stylish update of toolbox is determined to take the material in a supernatural direction and for the most part is successful,0
so what does he do about this jealousy well i'm glad you ask,0
why are things a catastrophe one minute and all fixed the next,0
go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind,0
all in all if you have to see a hk film that is n't directed by john woo or have chow yun fat in it this should be at least on your short list,0
it 's a very smart way to begin to the picture but little else occupied my mind after it got going,0
kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves,0
the godfather part ii ends with michael corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed,0
bosch is magnificent and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics kicks and simple acts of bravery,0
just the same this film is pure fiction,0
they even manage to show us how to properly demonstrate to some attractive ladies how to handle both a rifle and a bear trap,0
i 'll admit that the cruelty of some of these scenes is affecting but it 's hard to get away from the pervading feeling of stupidity,0
this is the biggest flop of 2008 i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster,0
this is a classic movie,0
there are no words about loyalty or knowing he 's a good guy deep down but we see it all in the man 's anguished silence and his wife 's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn,0
he of course gets beaten to a pulp in this scene to demonstrate the power of facial hair,0
when a contractor comes to demolish the building he explains the old gives space for the new to her and she finds that her new journey has begun,0
if not because of the fact that tens of thousands of american soldiers went mia in vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that america could be said to have lost,0
if you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now,0
however there 's only about 15 minutes of dialog at most,0
i did n't care for the homosexual twists and conclusions it could have been quite good without going into that territory,0
gilliam produced a long list and handed it to butch bruce,0
the dvd case is misleading in that it looks pretty interesting but that is about it,0
this is one that will end up in my home video collection,0
a farewell party is held and snoopy receives a fond farewell and a ton of gifts before he leaves a emotionally distraught charlie brown and crying little woodstock behind,0
god i love this movie,0
although mcnichol works overtime being effervescent and nearly makes the limp handling look endearing,0
why was he dating her anyway,0
duke togo while devoid of most emotion captivates as a steely and ruthless assassin bent on survival as well as completion of his tasks,0
no such luck for brian jonestown massacre,0
is n't that oh so charming and cute,0
instead we only have the overwrought and didactic musical score chaplin composed in 1970 his opening rendition of the saccharine swing little girl sung over the opening titles is plain bad both as music and as sung but thankfully passes quickly,0
the acting and outline of a movie should be put to the very first and i think the main problem with the movie will not be just an old piece but the attempt to be realistic and natural and the whole thing just get mixed up i think harley will be another sean but not that luck under the atmosphere of destruction and nothing to give him but to be yourself not to be too real after all you are acting people rushing into that theater not to see your lives but to see your understanding of the particular line of the story told by the diversity of all the human beings existing and living in the planet some et,0
come on all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at,0
but that 's just my opinion,0
third the story sucks its been used before and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse,0
poignant passionate and insightful it seems to be dropped in from another movie,0
i knew it was a classic of euro horror and i knew that it was supposed to be pretty gory,0
the only two actors who escape this are john malkovich and angelina jolie,0
in short the movie is just dull,0
what could have been a sweeping family saga was turned into a sappy boy loves horse opus for roddy mcdowell shortly after his successes in the lassie boy loves dog films,0
however the change of heart falls flat,0
throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you 'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film,0
i dearly hope that the actors in this film fade into insignificance as quickly as is possible and that everyone associated with the making of this film hastily follows suit,0
the whole thing is amateurish if you can view this movie without paying for it like if its on tv or for rent at the library then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of filmmaking,0
point blank this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,0
columbo says watch closely sir,0
a beautiful magical thoughtprovoking and heartwarming story,0
nancy drew lovers you must watch this,0
the most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone greenlit andor funded it i rented taboo solely for the normally talented amber benson who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film,0
so if someone does ask you to watch his erection be sure he wants to videotape it all,0
the music is decent and the dancing is average,0
so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies,0
i'ts certainly a contender for a dvd release,0
played in the credits and was made for th film,0
i am sure this production will be nominated for other awards,0
then i weep for our future,0
david warner and david suchet excel in their roles,0
what separates it from other 50 's scifi is the fact that the alien has no features no face eyes anything yet it ca n't be killed,0
i agree with most of users positive comments,0
first he gets to get past a bureaucratic police chief who is mostly all talk and no action,0

this movie was so bad that afterwards we had to break into our 4th of july fireworks early just so we could blow it up,0
as a great admirer of marlene dietrich i had to watch this very very dull picture,0
harry asks jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw 'last time',0
to his great good fortune however he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital,0
we are also privy to little known cinematic facts for example did you know that frequently 'movie' actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they are working,0
i had read an article about dan jansen 's olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie,0
i would also like to respond to the review of may 16 2005 this viewer was unhappy that the film was critical of the us but i think he misunderstood,0
good for small kids or for those who like fluff in large doses,0
the best voice jobs by the creators were saddam hussein and satan i could watch this film twenty times every day and never tire of it,0
he is dying and is visited i guess by angels,0
but why do they always speak english in the space future,0
and i do n't see the similarities that some reviewers do between that role and the one he plays in this film,0
this has to be one of the alltime best sleepers i have seen,0
tim roth plays one of the most evil despicable characters in film history,0
lousy performance by sylvia kristel emmanuel at one of the worst acting of the cinema history,0
this timeless tale of hate that blossoms into love is as good as it gets,0
the budget for the film is listed at 42 million dollars,0
we all know that the mutant villain has not made his last move,0
also inserted are quite clever and highly entertaining jokes ugly shooting and animation which is slightly mediocre,0
this is because one of the characters that does n't shut up is the great prince and he 's voiced by patrick stewart,0
suspense movies these days seem to get progressively worse,0
anyways i put this dvd in and all the sudden from the very first second it sucks,0
sure a lot of blood is spilled but really no more than any other gang film,0
to set it in the 70 's makes no sense and has no bearing on the story whatsoever,0
its sugarcoated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age,0
the change of setting is n't just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle,0
there is also a very graphic rape scene which if it had not been integral to the plot line could never have been acceptable to any audience,0
it sounded like oneeyed jacks,0
there are the requisite bodily function jokes but they do n't really drag the movie down very much as they are sparse and generally funny,0
her performance won her a second consecutive oscar the first time in history that happened,0
the setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house,0
for reasons i do n't understand mgm which held the rights to the student prince did not make a sound version until 1954 odd when you consider that during the thirties they had allan jones under contract who would have been wonderful in the part,0
let 's make a film that puts two chronically depressed socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are,0
there 's violence gore full frontal nudity warped dream sequences rape hardcore dinner table masturbation scenes and much more that you may not expect,0
unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero and i have to put something,0
basically this is an overlong unfunny actioncomedy,0
i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie,0
i remember 1999 and the only thing even remotely like this was son of the beach this review is horrible and poorly written lucky for you this show is n't,0
or did she as opposed to the other actors here perhaps resist the direction that was being given and merely follow her own course as far as interpreting her character,0
without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much,0
it is a low budget movie with a very simple and real storyline but the chemistry between ethan hawke and julie delpy is perfect and the dialogs are stunning,0
the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing,0
although beyond henry o'neill i'm unfamiliar with the supporting cast the players were uniformly excellent and the direction was taut,0
the storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway,0
there 's a run in her stocking,0
i 've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but i enjoyed it as much as any 8 film that i 've seen,0
perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster,0
it has a great sense of humor,0
confusing awful and overacted are words that come to mind when i think about her role,0
my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil but the way this movie was preaching it made it annoying,0
first is his use of space,0
i mean i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it but i actually though it 'd be good and have some subplot twists somewhere but nono it was just boring and dry,0
university professor justin thorne has got it made,0
the wartorn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen,0
the team does not do it because they think that they are maori they do it because of some of the issues shown in the movie,0
but i suppose bland coffee is better than none at all,0
the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour,0
let it be said i never heard the hype surrounding this film nor did i view this imdb page until after i saw it,0
i'm sure it was put in for additional ta but it was so slowly paced it caused anything going on prior to it to grind to a screeching and painful halt,0
the misgivings continued through the credits when i saw a cast of names that although recognizable hardly signal quality in a motion picture,0
so she strikes up a friendship with a fox,0
damned if i know throughout the entire movie the value and importance of these papers is continuously emphasized yet not one character ever reveals anything about their content,0
however there were obviously no dvd 's yet in 1982 and a tv special would perhaps had been too expensive and simplistic as a tribute,0
i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test,0
the wrestling scene in the ancient rome episode references the swordfight that turns into a wrestling match in chaplin 's film,0
his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films,0
i 've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now,0
michael bailey smith adds some muscle to the background as a navy seal,0

anyway enter columbo stage left in the brand new stylish brown raincoat his wife just bought him,0
now 36 years later i 've had a few strange encounters in my life but then so what,0
my personal favorite is tarzan and his mate due entirely to maureen o 'sullivan 's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front,0
this film sums up what 's good about small cinema,0
just do n't see it,0
it might be fun to have seen how william wyler or douglas sirk would have handled the same material,0
at the end of this movie i was truly dumbfounded,0
i'm not surprised at all that this went straight to video,0
martin especially chews the scenery in his role,0
even when they enter the house and drown a woman in her bathtub they say nothing,0
it has taken 3 years for the grey zone to arrive on australian shores and it has now gone straight to video,0
let me tell you something witty and funny,0
eight out of ten stars,0
it is rare to find a comedy that balances all three of these traits perfectly and mallrats succeeds immensely,0
featuring one frightening and fairly welldone sequence showing possessed boulders and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a camper,0
give sex and the city a bmovie treatment and this is what you get,0
producer mark burnett should be admired for dealing with stewart 's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she 's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman,0
yes even the narration was so bad it was funny,0
long scenes of virtually nothing happening are presented as apparently the director 's idea of suspense characters whine and fight with each other and sort of act scared but for some reason never all just decide to group together and leave the place,0
it does n't make much sense but in a way that fit with the rest of the movie,0
would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single,0
he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name,0
this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written,0
on the technical side all was brilliance as far as i could see,0
his fatherinlaw hates his guts,0
anybody who is sick to death of the standard glut of summer block busters has a lucky break here,0
it took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended i was so wrapped up in it,0
the title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease,0
the script is juvenile and predictable,0
seemingly dead the jock freaks out placing her body in a locked trunk,0
for roughly 75 minutes you are subjected to the worst acting and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre,0
the opening sequence alone is great,0
why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and hollywood the hell out of it when all it needed was good smart story telling,0
there are simply no redeeming qualities to it,0
it is far too difficult to make a preteen appear to be 35 i just see a spoiled little runt that rocket scientists would envy yet for some reason we are supposed to care that this adorable little sandy haired genius is doomed to the dark side,0
a truly great and creative movie worth watching many times,0
it 's not horror thats clear from the start,0
well it 's about time,0
perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and for my money the latter steals so many scenes from others she gets my vote as the outstanding player,0
it fell off into the toilet,0
director fred walton knows how to grab an audience,0
she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions,0
with a approaching christmas special which is supposed to tie up the ends for many characters we may soon be saying goodbye to little britain this may not be a bad thing however as its best to go out on top and if it continued i believe it would start to flounder as if series 3 is anything to go by the ideas is simply not there,0
the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky,0
the dvd cover presents this film as a comedy but i found it deeply disturbing,0
he must be in this for a reason,0
the film 's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett,0
and the fact that all africanamerican characters are the typical stereotypes makes the movie even more hypocritical,0
but i still love their music,0
the only problem with that is that peter lind hayes is a truly awful actor,0
the boy was a little much but the girl character was very interesting,0
still the movie does work,0
there is also a plot with kenny going to hell and finding saddam hussein and satan in love,0
looking for revenge and bling bling,0
the whole story seems kind of muddled with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so,0
i truly hate this film and i hope that there is never a sequel to it,0
warning spoiler i had not expected some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it caught me off guard,0
too bad he did n't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk or chopping your tail off,0
you see familiar faces like sheila keith patsy byrne and frank finlay,0
one solid acting turn appears among this slag stan abe as a zealous fbi agent,0
could n't stand listening to the badly written dialogue i mean who the heck wrote that script,0
nothing makes sense on any other level,0
while their mother starts being happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in evie evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do,0
the reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept suffer even and then they can go on with their lives their life,0
still though not as bad as spock 's brain,0
by the way the killer must have had a really big death wish to do something so utterly stupid in his final scene,0
miller 's character seems much too busy to have a social life but then we suddenly discover she 's been promised to a man named walter w walter ii,0
even the layout is preserved where possible so you 'll recognize various situations if you 've seen the film,0

the title song is another nice song and nicely shot,0
the family interviews are touching and tragic,0
and i 've got two answers,0
i found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent naked gun movies,0
this however is a sad excuse for a film,0
ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story,0
but no they could n't do that not as long as there was money to be made,0
cranes are flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply,0
lewis stone is perfectly cast as the hero who goes to the island on a rescue mission only to be attacked by legions of dinosaurs,0
available now in dvd do not miss either,0
it is by far the movie of all movies,0
before tiny 's reappearance or resurrection ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon marcus josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith ross mccall who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them,0
the plot is overly centered on benigni as if the entire movie is only about him,0
stars like tony shalhoub bring the tale to life,0
highly recommended to fans of the writer and the stars,0
the monster is amazingly cheap looking but this is something we all knew i guess,0
you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but it 's far from that,0
i love indy films and expected to dig this too,0

anne tells us about how much she hates her mother adele,0
i tell you this because there are almost no good things in it,0
in scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog,0
i am also a little confused about one thing,0
the rest of this film should get used to collecting dust on video store shelves across the country,0
then someone dressed as demon jumps on the star he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he 's a worker at the haunted maze,0
to movie making feel to it as if this film was made as a class project,0
necessary 5 minute scene at strip club in atlanta,0
i did see it in the program listed as a mockumentary,0
but not too terrible in a bad way,0
it 's predictable but still fun is to be had here,0
one of the best if not the best silent or purely graphic comedies ever made,0
overall this game is an absolute worth trying,0

up at the villa is not a bad film,0
it 's slaughterhouse 5 except billy pilgrim 's out to destroy the world one image at a time,0
before i wrap this up i 'd like to say that i 'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i do n't think i 've seen every episode,0
a few people that have quite a bit of blood on them but that 's all,0
in fact this would have made an hilarious 45 minute tv special,0
they all start to cough up blood and look very sick,0
like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced realistic and intense,0
roll on chronicles of riddick,0
if you enjoy music and indie movies this is for you,0
no twists turns or tension,0
it follows pretty closely in the footsteps of lamberto bava 's demons films,0
this documentary should also be a mustsee for any straight married couple it may make them stop taking their union and each other for granted after all it 's a right that is not afforded to all,0

the music is brilliant and the film is beautiful despite the ugliness of slavery,0
after accused of the murder the police visit all the places he had been with her but people only remember him being alone,0
the miniseries also has the story from the dea,0
her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health,0
numerous scenes in this dragged on effortlessly while the end was a complete ripoff of identity and high tension,0
except even where the movie follows that party animal meets anal villain story line and completely follows the book on ski movies nothing much happens,0
al and annie getting it on was cool as was the music during the entire scene,0
anyway this film even gives more,0
'ring 2' is a nice mix of the best elements of its predecessor and some intriguing new material but it 's also a slightly uneasy one too,0
in fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes,0
in short the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude,0
kaufman studios have always made the cheesy gory flicks that delivered,0
sure the word is said many times throughout the film but what do you expect when the title is the word itself,0
great acting and thrilling story line,0
a young john bennett perry could have filled the part of alex amply but at his present age he is relegated to playing alex 's dad and his wife is jill clayburgh who in the few minutes that she 's on looks like she 's wondering what possessed her to say yes to this movie,0
how exactly did the creators imagine the repeated use of the same shots would be unnoticed,0
though i am really not getting the whole broomsticks with arms thing,0
they look more like four homely college freshman than hot high school fashion types and the student body looks just as bland,0
there 's a slight drawback for bakshi fans in this facet of character design bakshi went as far as to say it 's more frazetta than him,0
after getting the audience used to rocking back and forth through the emotional spectrum the film throws a curve with a sequence that does n't go from good to bad and back but instead escalates from an ordinary marital spat through an accidental selfinflicted knife wound that may or may not require stitches to an earthquake that has the characters run from the house,0
unfortunately the film then peters out and the rest of it meanders along with no sense of tension or character development,0
due to a rival drug dealer the boy cannot make it because he gets kidnapped,0
afterward she is shown as being easily scared and intimidated,0
their stepmother whose livelihood depends on closeness with an artist,0

one of kings most gruesome books has been transformed to a story for children,0
i would n't have had a chance,0

the moore stunts looked like those old lowbudget chopsocky kungfu movies especially with the bad editing,0
didnt know what the two kids were in it for at the start but they ties some storylines together nicely,0
and we can decide for ourselves if we can separate the artist from the art but more importantly we have to decide if we can separate ourselves from the art,0
periodically i check to see if blind spot has been distributed,0
the length of 15 hours is much too long because after 10 minutes you have seen almost every joke,0
it 's not enough to indulge your vision,0
the best joke which i do n't want to give away is another great stunt as he attempts to catch up with the runaway train as he is being chased by soldiers,0
there was so many plot holes i lost count,0
dunst herself is n't bad,0
this is a clear example of friends cast and crew of this film just logging on and giving it a 10,0
man on fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of mexico,0
a found tape about 3,0
he said his lines like it too,0
the plot is a twisted make of several films at best,0
it is said that byron walked with a limp,0
you maybe right to a degree,0
john lone does what he can with a poorly written role but even the one or two good scenes in which appears ca n't save this train wreck,0
also the screenplay by julian barry is totally engaging,0
it 's freaking stupid it 's an insult to your intelligence,0
with the nurses and aids it 's the same story,0
korvo is notorious for making his living by taking advantage of unsuspecting women and blackmailing them,0
is it 100 accurate and is it a little sappy in places,0
and have you ever spent 8 nights in a steam bath looking for a man,0
seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie,0
in fact he is the only worthy part of surf ii,0
i never realized the hard work that dancers go through and they deserve credit for sticking with such a difficult occupation and the training they go through,0
there are a few slow points in the film but that is not enough to disregard it,0
there are sets so you can feel like you are in different places in paris,0
this documentary outlines how a few young folks took the surfing concepts and extended them to skateboarding,0
this is n't one of them,0
this is fun and i love the way mcgregor plays the virgin office boy,0
took a very good book and completely butchered it,0
a close and friendly bonding develops between the captors and the captives,0
but it 's also great acting the way they change their voices and their body movement the really become other people,0
it seems that once a week the town is nearly destroyed,0
instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss,0
however the narrative which is hit and miss in all of argento 's films is missing here,0
living in bristol where blackbeard lived and drank in a pub that still stands today i thought i would give this a try,0
when you expect a shot to disappear to dissolve or be cut away from it does n't always happen,0
basically it 's rubbish badly edited poorly constructed rubbish,0
actually sucked would be a compliment,0
james gandolfini plays the enigmatic new jersey crime boss tony soprano accompanied by a stellar cast,0
basically ben and arthur is indescribably bad but unintentionally the most comical thing you 'll see for a long time,0
death trap is basically a cut price hillbilly psycho rip off,0
in the alternative future created by our alternative past the future will receive the sample from us but they wo n't be able to control it and time will end,0
dogmatic as another reviewer described this film is a fitting word,0
apparently they did n't get along,0
the film is 76 mins of rubbish the thing in the cellar looks like it belongs in a 50 's scifi film and is nothing like the cover for the film,0
beautiful funny sad touching a must see film,0
just as in rififi the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfected silence of the jewel heist,0
laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it,0
i 've rated this a 1 primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles refusing to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an american audience,0
i did n't like any of the characters and we 've seen them all before in so many other films,0
for example say this slowly with a serious austrian accent you should not drink and bake,0
following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man 's legacy is exactly as such,0
if i wanted a history lesson i 'd sit at this computer and read wikipedia or something,0
ok i kinda like the idea of this movie,0
in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work,0
in his introduction to the video release of johnny guitar martin scorsese describes the film as operatic and the same term applies to pursued which he also chose for the martin scorsese presents collection,0
this film is just some love affair that the producer has with some undisciplined arrogant pushy little squirt who he expects the audience to admire,0
this is his achilles heel and it makes the audience realize that for all the glamor and fame he is not a happy man,0
few movies have the power to move you and this one did me,0
peter falk gives the performance of his life,0
none of the phantasm sequels have been able to live up to the legendary mystique of the original,0
i want to see someone do that speech in a drama class,0
that said the special effects are quite good for the time and the acting does it 's best with such a daft story,0
apparently the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers,0
meanwhile the phantom carriage is approaching,0
go watch the real django,0
it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me,0
the glass eye worn by him made him look comical not menacing,0
as for me i got physically sick just watching it and will not attempt it again for the sake of my own sanity,0
the bad guys have stolen a killer virus and are intending to let it loose to make a fortune selling the antidote,0
evil is as evil does,0
the set of the main characters serves as a great backdrop for their bantering dialog,0
you watch it and suddenly you ca n't make a difference between it the many american ninja hotdog movies hong kong rubbish,0
it is a hybrid between alien and chain saw massacre,0
all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication,0
as a high school student subjected to watch this film by an extremely intelligent teacher im ashamed that he would choose this to show to us,0
pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw,0
see this movie and get inspired,0
as the film progressed we were introduced to the characters of the film as well as what happened in the prison riots,0
excellent movie albeit slightly predictable,0
apart from very bad acting writing and direction this movie could not decide what it was supposed to be,0
after being married for half a day and a night herman is send to the front again,0
the acting is beyond awful the score is okay the plot sounded cool but the movie is not,0
it will truly remain dear to your heart forever,0
after all an imagination is a much more powerful tool than a cheesy television film,0
some people may be offended by the humor but it 's done tastefully,0
it is basically the same riff he had done in the majority of his films,0
when things go south within hours enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold,0
but there 's a downside see the next point,0
on the whole a pointless mess of cheese ham and clich that roger corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless desperate moments,0
not about poor people but about rich people who want to get richer and they use the poor peoples money to do it,0
i was n't fully sure what to expect and nearly did n't watch it at all that would have been a mistake,0
they had time to include this garbage yet skip vital character development later in the film,0
people have to take responsibility for their actions,0
and thank god this show only lasted one season,0
he also encounters enough hollywood movie stars to fill a stanley kramer movie including comedy luminaries like richard pryor steve martin edgar bergen milton berle and mel brooks,0
make sure you read it,0
the paris segment steals the show,0
a reporter who feels sorry for sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb,0
vitus is distant too initially anyway,0
as in an earlier comment the mystery science theater 3000 version known as final sacrifice is a hilarious spoof of this canadian made movie,0
the killer is n't the stalker either,0
they are among my favorite genres of film,0
this was such a movie worth staying up for,0
i'm scared for the future,0
there are certainly wicked people whether or not they should die is for another film,0
in an early running gag fay grim 's son ned is so frequently told to leave that you ca n't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad,0
salman khan who plays the role of prem fits the role to a t even when it turns out that he is a prince not so charming he does not lose the audience 's sympathy,0
he at least deserves a lot of praise for being so versatile,0
borneo was the original one,0
the intent is the same to terrorize disrupt lives destroy property and kill americans,0
there were literally no redeeming features about this film,0
when i walked in i wondered why the theatre was empty,0
feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way,0
actually the fact that no one answers the phone in both cases might be exactly the reason why the fateful car crash appears in both scenarios claire decides to return because she is getting worried about simon andor peter,0
there are other pretentious and annoying little snippets within this film such as a repeating animal noise and other symbolic imagery and sounds,0
with what i feel is an imaginative introduction i felt that this film many realise some inventive material,0
it 's hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is,0
two of the town 's elders sensing there is no public for this type of entertainment have decided to cancel their sunday concerts in favor of a more popular orchestra that will attract a wider audience,0
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a outrageous story,0
much like the pixar movies it 's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today 's world,0
this film really misses the mark on most fronts,0
i saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant,0
then he makes crap like this which just shows that he is going no where,0
they had such a hard life,0
all in all a quirky little number that tickled me just right i ca n't help but think that maybe it missed it 's mark with certain audiences,0
i guess if you never saw the commercial you may think this is some hot stuff,0
the young couple is there to investigate the place 's dark history the dysfunctional family considers reopening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex,0
i'm also fairly certain that they killed an actual rattlesnake in the making of swamp women,0
the film is set in russia in the midst of the war,0
truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of moviemaking heaven,0
yet another film about a tortured selfcentered arrogant unfeeling hateful selfdestructive lead character we are supposed to care about,0
evil monks search new york city in the late 1980 's for virgin sacrifices,0
we feel for him and those around him as his bad influence spreads and the tragic tale takes a turn for the worst,0
lots of ugly naked people thanks thats just what i wanna see the jokes were n't funny either,0
for example near the end colbert marries george reeves even though she admits she knows almost nothing about the man,0
smart witty and fast paced is going to net a smaller audience,0
overall i loved this movie and watch it whenever i get a chance to,0
after seeing this you 'll never watch another low budget movie in the same way again and that 's a good thing,0
if you 're a fan of the show do yourself a favor and seek it out,0
it 's sort of a buddy film with overthetop violence and gore deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of craziness,0
the secondary story even less we fail to even understand why it is there,0
this movie fails at that,0
this film is a truly underrated classic,0
that is what makes this show so great,0
it is a terrific picture to look at,0
while i do n't doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge,0
and lionel atwill is just wasted,0
it does n't follow any emotional threads,0
the story of believers is about two paramedics who are on an emergency call to rescue a woman lying conveniently in front of a gas station having some sort of a heart attack,0
hackman turns in a decent performance as he usually does he has a good scene with dunaway and a number of good lines with o 'donnell,0
the movie follows 17 year old nathan who is in love with mumba 's character jessica,0
she is even more rude than zoey herself if that is even possible and even more dumber than nicole and hell we know that cannot be possible,0
eva longoria parker is pretty mediocre,0
araki uses amazing visuals and a beautiful pop soundtrack to convey to us his character 's emotions and by the end of the film somehow i understood everything that he was trying to say,0
two friends are debating on skipping class,0
its hard to be a cinephile and consistently stay engaged,0
he 's a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious,0
i'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market,0
it was the first two hour episode that introduced michelle and had a spectacular gunfight at the end on the streets of little saigon,0
this is about a quest and magic and swords and knights not about special effects,0
a lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a grisham novel,0
the script also felt very contrived,0
not in the real world,0
but now i do n't,0
rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic,0
god is love and i think god wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like god does n't care about true love only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with,0
a once seemingly flamboyant and empowered macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy,0
it took quite a while before i could figure out all of the pieces of this scheme and the people involved which i enjoy,0

4 last i recall gen is not old friends with bison,0
although harriet bullies all three in both subtle and overt ways the housekeeper manages to retain her selfrespect while the maid crumbles and the cousin surrenders,0
the lead actors do their scenes well,0
it 's a jumbled mess that only did well because of the very large and very expensive marketing,0
but what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these st shows constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures as tho they are offering some insight into american religious zealots,0
americans in our zeal are always trying to improve on things that need no improvement and we generally screw things up when we do,0
is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top,0
my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music,0
but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it 's too late it all begins to take a toll on caine 's mind,0
a female judge is fighting against rich evil powerful and corrupt men,0
i loved it i have seen other movies of his and they were also funny but this one really stick out in my mind because of the humor his i just ca n't say enough about this movie,0
i could n't remember the name of th movie or who played in it but i could n't get the scene of albert finney on the commercial set near the end of the movie out of my mind,0
in all that time the psychlos never found fort knox though gold is high on their shopping list nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold,0
the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness,0
okay first of all notice how all of the other reviewers who gave this movie a good rating are either a from canada or b helped work on this movie or the second one,0
not just because i'm blown away but the story and the fact it is true but the characters blow me away,0
many songs are used to underscore montages or scenes the few that do n't are relegated to show biz numbers,0
he is just another fellow a family man trying to do his job and get ahead,0
if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems,0
really not worth your time,0
his persona is the result of his character not his circumstances,0
this series is the ultimate blend of british comedy and lowbudget scifi,0
consider it internally and only then discuss it externally,0
we see drama through drought famine 2 wars there is rivalry unsurpassed and he has a poem i only wish i could remember it to put on here that sums his whole life,0
this movie is firmly placed at the status of the worst movie ever,0
what is shown is the incredible poverty in sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the 'new' world of america,0
the same goes with an awful student film i made in high school,0
working as an alpine hotel maid a swiss miss prima donna tries to capture her composer husband 's attention with a little help from stan laurel oliver hardy,0
the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end and we watched the entire movie,0
i just saw it at the toronto international film festival,0
heart of gold med student the whole painful project is an ordeal to watch and i was unable to go beyond a half hour i confess,0
but this is one movie which breaks my mold and i consider a new classic,0
and if this is not enough it 's too talky and the stunts are few and far,0
but overall despite some new twists it 's reasonably stupid,0
the other problem is the main characters seem almost schizophrenic in their personalities,0
i was very pleased with the movie i thought it was a wonderful plot,0
it has definitely changed my perception of european movies,0
in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer and popeye is in deep um water,0
for instance scenes at a fertility clinic are not in the least funny and are quite frankly embarrassing,0
the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated,0
it 's the kind of movie that i might watch if it was on tv and there was nothing else on and i was too tired to get up and find the remote but i would not suggest that anyone should rent this movie,0
while the movie and acting is pretty bad this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too,0
a lovely film thanks to good but distorted writing excellent acting and brisk direction,0
the first part was really the one which had it in it and think they though that people will see this one because of it,0
this is not me 'not getting it',0
well i can mix my own corn syrup and red food coloring at home thanks and i dont have to read subtitles half the time to do it,0
kudos to the director for assembling a really outstanding set of actors,0
i surprised myself and cried,0
i am no russian but i am learning right now,0
unfortunately the task was beyond the writer and director 's grasp and far beyond that of the cast,0
it also is a fine piece of film making featuring good acting and an intelligent script,0
he played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well,0
cannon was a quality quinn martin production with logical situations good suspense and fast pacing,0
charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power,0
in addition the thing that really makes this special worth watching is the score especially little birdie and linus and lucy,0
it is a bereaved indian father who gives peter the absolution he craves not his brothers or his mother,0
chuck jones and michael maltese are always favorites of mine in the writerdirector team category because of these hilarious hunting trilogy cartoons i 've laughed at since i was a kid,0
a few things pops into mind,0
i have recently watched orient express on dvd and wish to provide imdb 's readers with a few comments,0
i give it 2 stars one for the fact that the picture is visible and one for the fact that the dialogue is audible,0
like on deadly ground and fire down below seagal centers the movie around his environmental awareness message and how the military fbi and cia are incompetent idiots,0
stark is an old scene stealing pro,0
can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless,0
he is great at building characters in his novels but there just is n't enough time to do that in a movie,0
after finishing watching the movie my friend said to me do you realize that we just watched over 2 hours of video about nothing,0
how many times have we seen this already,0
now this film is n't going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller one well that 's three reasons is n't it,0
the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist does n't help,0
in fact we are worried when there are no shootings in the background,0
well i just got back from seeing gangs of new york at the theater and i have many positive things to say about this film,0
dodos claims that scientists have good answers to the questions posed by id but those answers require time and a depth of knowledge to understand,0
but the rule was broken here,0
but for me this is the definitive version of the film,0
thirty or so minutes in we were wondering if we had rented a movie that had never actually been watched by the person writing the promotional material,0
it 's a quiet kind of horror that is n't made anymore,0
the kids do n't know a thing though,0
wedding slashers is a direct descendant of those trashy low budget 70s horror films,0
never before and never again someone achieved such a sharp and cynical portrait of hollywood,0
let 's stab the knockers,0
but let 's focus on the positive forest of the damned is a great example of how not to make a movie,0
he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever i especially loved all of his funny facial expressions and dancing during put on a happy face,0
i know it 's old but that 's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 a bland flat dull boring misleading film such as the vampire bat just does n't cut it these days just look at the original king kong released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today,0
i remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and do n't know if this is the same one,0
you have better ways to waste your time overall,0
the best of the best,0
its campy it has bad acting i i really loved this movie alot,0
i gave the film 710,0
out of context video meets out of context prejudice,0
this is the best film version of a wonderful book,0
unfortunately someone has murdered her that very day,0
it 's like no attempt was made to light the scenes it 's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything,0
and seeing it again as an adult brings all that excitement back to me,0
so let 's get to some major issues right now,0
a ten yearold might like it,0
but in one of his poorest performances william frawley is quite irritating,0
i think that although the acting is n't all that great it 's really just a bunch of guys having fun with a script,0
if you see this in the video store or on netflix just keep browsing,0
it 's not the last one as the film is wholly guided by a series of coincidences that gradually has the various members of the family crossing each others paths,0
and to to think that oliver stone 's jfk took over 3 hours lumumba runs under 2 hours,0
the trouble is that the technical quality is so godawful the movie is intolerable,0
no this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace,0
the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies in my opinion,0
look at how he tries to establish where the racing cars are that he hears but cannot see on the open road,0
i wo n't go into all the details but there are a few reasons i know of why she rewrote a large chunk of the dialogue,0
overall film could not rise above mediocre,0
in some ways i was right,0
john carradine again plays a sinister dracula,0
this film is an interesting period curiosity that is worth watching but the 2002 film with michael caine and brendan frasier is much better and much truer to greene 's novel,0
when i was done watching it i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same,0
all in all the best animated series i 've seen,0
this is nothing like the original american psycho,0
in the latter film angelopoulos' views contradict the official greek history and constitute a fundamental revision of history in which the left in general and the communist party of greece in particular are given their proper places and are not depicted as the moral threat to greek democracy,0
he worked as a ice cream salesman and he 's also a warrior at heart,0
their children are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a putupon wife,0
the movie becoming a superduper hit,0
only copper sky is a far cry from the african queen,0
no real arguments are made here about the subjects of moore 's documentaries besides that these people have just discovered film editing wow,0
if you want to see a humorous movie about the hijinks of an odd group of characters looking to enrich themselves during a wwii battle see kelly 's heroes instead of this movie,0
and by god you 'll wish he had,0
that had come before in the sound era with walter huston and a year after young mr lincoln raymond massey did the pulitzer prize winning play by robert sherwood abe lincoln in illinois,0
the summary says it all,0
the acting is certainly good enough for a bmovie,0
not once do we see gomez trailing kisses along morticia 's arm and in the beginning of the movie where we are offered a tidbit of the two in bed together which i suppose is meant to be teasing i was surprised to find that the scene incorporated none of the sensuality that accompanied gomez and morticia in the previous two movies,0
the two groups stand up and go on firing without ducking or hiding until one group has 100 casualties,0
he goes out searching for a universal remote finding only bed bath and beyond to be open,0
it never came out here so i was excited when it came,0
oh by the way advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie,0
no but it was awesome just the same,0
this film very subtly points out crumb is not really anything he 's been accused or praised for being,0
it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails,0
the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus,0
honestly i saw home movies that had more virtuosity than this,0
those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another,0
had gielgud seen boom he would have held his tongue,0
special fx are n't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action is n't going to blow you out of the chair,0
the special effect were horrible i had n't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology,0
unfortunately i'm one of those people who has to watch a movie in it 's entirety before forming an opinion,0
the plot flies follows no apparent path and the action leaps from prehistoric settings to aztecs back to reality to the wild west so quickly that one wonders how the film received funding at all,0
death played by eugene levy has made a mistake taking lance before his number was up,0
imamura has at least been coherent in this the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake,0
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film,0
it 's a fact that all unknown movies are n't all bad,0
in theory this would make a pretty good action scifi movie or at least an interesting teeny flick,0
halfway through the movie there 's a mediocre twist,0
a very memorable film rather obscure and highly recommended,0
mcphee created a beautiful documentation of history that many are not aware but need to be,0
a few nights ago i was in a mild state of insomnia and found that fox was airing highway,0
let me make it clear that i did n't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have,0
the killer is often knocked over andor falls unconscious,0
apart from donald pleasence and daria nicolodi the performances are also godawful,0
the concept of unity and those who have gone before is a huge part of the hr culture and the message behind the haka for any of those that are familiar with it support those values,0
this was the second of the series of 6 classic tarzan movies featuring johnny weismuller in the title role and maureen o 'sullivan as jane,0
so much for the good,0
there are no catholic schools for girls in stockholm at least not of importance since catholicism is a less important religion than islam in sweden,0
that does n't mean i did n't enjoy it though no i loved every minute of it,0
right from the start light 's girlfriend dying,0
this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the imagery,0
daffy duck claims to be robin hood to friar tuck,0
much of the plotting was completely not understandable,0
all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred,0
one excellent twist in the script is that his character is not intelligent,0
this movie was made and distributed by the mormon church,0
this movie is the beatle fan 's worst nightmare 1 ian hart does n't resemble john lennon 2 i do n't believe that john had an affair with astrid he was in love with cynthia at the time,0
i remember the first movie was okay so i decided to see the second one only because the trailer made it seem like she was in the same setting as the resident evil 2 video game,0
you just wish that women like her really existed,0
it 's hard to get behind a cast when they 're forced to play clueless morons for the sake of the plot,0
so who cares if parts of it look like lowbudget cheese,0
r o b o t j o x burn the master,0
its hit men are like the hired killers of pulp fiction are violent yet philosophical its take on soap operas terrific spoof material and its acting is the best feature of all,0
i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this,0
it deserves more than that as it is good but sadly not everyone thinks so,0
jack bender 's the tempest is an adaption of shakespeare 's play the tempest,0
the highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes which features actors patterned after clint eastwood lee van cleef and someone else who are confronted by stranger,0
i do n't really know how else to say that,0
if you believe this movie was even remotely entertaining than you may have been tricked by a talent less writer,0
this movie final fantasy 7 advent children based off the ultra popular rpg for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time,0
clint has a memorable role as a forrest bum that meets his demise from the ticks,0
quite a lesson of how to create characters and how to make a great movie with a few sets and with six or seven actors,0
oh but sylvia kristel was naked in it so let 's give it 5 out of 10 stars,0
nor does this sentence move the story forward in any way,0
but instead he made himself all the more recognisable,0
in sum it 's funny it 's smart it 's inspiring to filmmakers who believe a good story along with support from competent actors and dp 's and friends and crafty is all you need,0
considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases,0
on a final note i did get a distinct feel watching the film that it seemed at times more like a tv movie than a true theatrical film,0
the high point is the song and dance of two face woman with joan and the entire chorus in black face,0
i 'd read that you could see the bar holding up the spaceship in flight or that it flies against a blue sky while from the inside of the ship space looks black,0
its obviously not an attempt to get only profit and maybe even an oscar nomination but still it is an easy movie to watch,0
this program is a favorite of our family and we feel it must be released on dvd by seasons,0
this could have been great,0
bingo in my opinion is a cute movie about a very special friendship between a boy and a dog,0
but the scares that were in this movie were very effective,0
if you have ever loved or are in love it will make you cry,0
i also though the two less hollywood actors edgar ramirez and said taghmaoui did great job in portraying their characters and were stern on screen,0
then the villain rides off into the distance,0
considering how funny van wilder 's party liaison was and that the character of taj was great in it you would expect more from this follow up,0
the audio was so poor that i had to turn the volume up just to hear it and when there was gunfire it almost blew my audio system apart,0
laura dern 's character connie is a spoiled rebellious selfish teen who has nothing on her mind but boys and fun,0
my friend says this is the sign of mental retardation not of supreme concentration,0
i ca n't do it justice,0
if i had to criticise one element it is that the music swells just a little too much a couple of times but it is a good score nonetheless,0
the films few strong points can be found in these sections,0
i knew i had seen it on tv many years ago guess it 's not shown anymore possibly because of racial overtones,0
heflin 's technically the center of the movie the patsy racing around to prove his innocence,0
bolo yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies,0
but steven king 's it handcuffed me and after two weeks i completed the book,0
jo a new age type realizes that delia is a bit weird after turning all her white crystals black and calls her new age guru noah jim byrnes to come over and check her out,0
people vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugarcoated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths weaknesses and performance,0
once i sat back and watched i was taken in by the dialogue the transition from scene to scene and the way the movie got me to think about the bigger picture,0
the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent,0
in this one it 's the dog,0
hard times hard life adapt and survive,0
instead a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders,0
the creepiness catches you completely off guard,0
i was surprised to see that this early john waters movie was available on video presuming it would be long out of print,0
and again chan goes up against the same rival from the young master and the timing and energy here is brilliant,0
she looks and sounds like a junkie,0
this could have been a very good film a very interesting look at ancient tradition and oral history but it should have been a short subject,0
this goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits,0
michael york is was and always will be great but minnelli actually succeeds in dragging him down to her level,0
said the continuity announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast,0
showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced,0
that should be all you need to know,0
this movie is a typical teens get into trouble on the road story,0
not exactly a rhodes scholar she had a simple goal in life get married and be a good wife because that 's what 's expected of proper girls from tulsa,0
the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved,0
this show is highly underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate quality,0
i was barely able to watch this movie once a year ago,0
not that anything is in fact easy to make out in this picture,0
instead we get potty humor,0
i 'll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is,0
the outcome the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all,0
keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and does n't think a woman should coach sports,0
it is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in 1950 's italy are adapted to 2002 's usa,0
great pacing and a nuanced score round out a twisty tale filled with sex betrayal and surefire one liners,0
you all know why you 're interested in this film in the first place right,0
yes this movie had the same feel like the other shark films did but thats what was partly so good about this film i will add though that it did have a twist,0
do n't go if you want to see sarah in another buffy episode because it is very different from her buffy work much more serious,0
it is a knockoff of butterfly effect and the acting is subpar,0
the effects in this leave a little to be desired and any attempt at eroticism is kind of rendered laughable especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat,0
another actress was highly necessary for scarlett as well as rhett,0
there are some films like santa claus the movie or indeed hook that are continually panned by critics and cynics alike,0
1 the script is total bs,0
so there you have it,0
in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place,0
as richard hickock scott wilson is no less fine,0
what more can you expect from an actor,0
she 's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her,0
what if that person was in a situation where he or she could try to get revenge,0
jerry a comic genius plays carrie 's father arthur spooner whom lives in doug and carrie 's always cold basement,0
and for another thing you ca n't help but laugh at the irony,0
it does n't contain much of his surrealism,0
the editing also makes the plot confusing at times,0
i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle,0
i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community,0
it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula,0
miyazaki 's studio ghibli shows his wonderful touch animating infusing life in every little action of the characters in ponyo,0
the overriding theme is not man creating artificial life and the consequences of this action,0
i understand that christmas movies are normally heartwarming sweet and touching,0
and robin williams' genie in aladdin i mean if this is your gripe then you just do n't get disney movies,0
did they simply show up at that bar every night hoping she would come and see them,0
this artificiality might seem at first disconcerting yet it is of a hitchcockian efficiency and strictly functional,0
did n't really capture arbus unique visual aesthetic and certainly none of her character likeness or life save some very superficial similarities she was a fashion who later photographed freaks and outsiders among many things,0
why they had to change the setting away from celtic countries saxon mythology i have no idea,0
the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and filmmaking,0
valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role,0
molly is a pregnant teacher who is close to the delivery,0
4 less than a half dozen animals on pandora and all but the floating jellyfish are angry and violent,0
yen along with her friends are looking for her missing brother despite the warning from her medium mother that he 's dead,0
kane fights the new marshal a number of times shooting back and forth never getting hit utilizing almost every bankrupt western movie convention known to humanity,0
technically a disgusting shot film,0
wes makes for a very interesting lead and the plot leaves clues and questions that only the planned series could have answered,0
after the screening director gorman bechard was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good,0
other curiosities abound as well,0
but even this might not matter if the film were n't the overlong bore that it is,0
every clich ever conceived is in there and in all the wrong places,0
a ghost with his tongue hanging out,0
the fact that the murderer turns out to be a catholic priest,0
thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience,0
the so called native people shift from white to asian to black randomly from scene to scene,0
soon the whole neighborhood is following the handcuffed lodger,0
i have actually seen better acting in low budget porn,0
i 've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed,0
the acting is so bad it 's hard to believe,0
i wo n't tell you who wins but the film 's amoral heart is revealed when the party house led by smirking dean cameron choose to cheat in order to compete,0
while this film looks good it has the values of a pop clip which is indicated by the use of music either it 's from the wrong era and just a french clich or just new age nonsense,0
ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with,0
if this would be written in a book it would be a short story because the action in the movie is very fast paced and unless you actually try to catch it the reasoning behind the plot can very well pass you by,0
sure you have to wonder what happened to the kids but you also feel hope that maybe a couple of them got smart and got a job,0
and i find it completely unfathomable that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it,0
i checked this out for free at the library and i still feel ripped off,0
while tilda swinton does another one of her typically marvelous performances it is amber tamblyn who displays the surprisingly great acting chops in this film,0
think evil dead 1000 the acting is horrible you can see the makeup line on a certain lady 's face,0
it had absolutely nothing going for it,0
that 's a rare combination,0
i love the non violent drama and the colorful scenery,0
the comic relief is anything but comic,0
i ca n't get enough of his special kind of colorful camp,0
at 160 minutes long it is readily apparent that it should have been edited to under 2 hours,0
will is driven by selfpity and only gets interested in the battle when he finds he has real power and then he becomes a rather selfrighteous little jerk,0
it 's probably started filming even now after all it should n't take mr shell too long to muster up the 7 new pence and half a packet of wine necessary to complete production,0
you 'll only know if you watch and watch you should for this is a topnotch mystery thriller or should i say a giallo,0
the final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart those eyes i'm guessing that he made this film in between the dr who series and that makes it even more of an achievement for me,0
quentin tarantino is just getting worse with every movie,0
he says his piece and leaves needing to say no more,0
while the conclusion may be a bit unsatisfying there are some neat toughguy scenes as the crooks position themselves to get their hands on the loot which is being held by the big guy,0
this is the general motto with the film,0
ajax 's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior,0
a large part of the reason why is that mimic 2 is completely different in tone than the first mimic,0
and i was not disappointed one bit,0
yes there 's a hint of sappiness here and there especially at the ending but what 's wrong with that,0
i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy,0
what she does n't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress,0
yes this review may contain spoilers but you 'll thank me for it,0
i watched it last night and i almost put my head through the tv,0
the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented,0
the main character is dante hicks a college dropout who gets a phone call from his boss saying he has to work on his day off,0
because with all of these so called scientist experts working on how to kill them you would think the solution would be harder then taking a trip to your local home depot,0
we instantly realize there 's a story being told and in order for us to pay attention everything has to move slowly,0
sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set,0
i hated the way that this movie made me feel but could n't stop watching,0
some of these sketches made me chuckle but for the most part every sketch went on way way too long,0
this movie did n't try anything tremendously fancy or new it took a lot of things we 've seen before and turned out a movie that was more than the sum of its parts,0
i'm not suggesting at all that the reviewer had the same motivation but the expectations must have been different as the ones of those among us that went to see a talented and beautiful actress play an almost classic role because that 's what we got,0
sipping coffee that he stirs with his carrot,0
what other movie besides dahmer would you find a guy who keeps body parts in his freezer who actually like,0
i guess i'm not a serious horror fan but i do know when something is just plain old entertaining,0
again not good but not a profound disaster,0
the kids were good i loved emma she was wonderful,0
entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of it 's a wonderful life,0
i 'd imagine the budget did n't allow the filmmakers to show it,0
they were sent to prison they were ready to be sent to a psychiatric asylum but the main theme of this film get ready to action the media,0
what part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct but no one notices,0
oh and they are huge,0
everyone in the state of louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept,0
being a fan of xmen comics and cartoons i watched this movie with great skepticism,0
another interesting point is that the physician 's name is dr pasolini,0
she has recently had a brain tumor removed and was told that she made a complete recovery,0
while she is looking for a parking space she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her,0
it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts,0
as nasty as this is it just might find a niche with creature feature aficionados who also happen to be splatter fans,0
suffice to say these two men battle it out physically and psychologically one long weekend,0
thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls,0
it was a fun romp with some cool music,0
a detective emily sanders becomes interested in the case and starts helping hank outside of her job,0
the filmmaker switches to her point of view sometimes and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby or clutching at a drowned child,0
the only member he would n't be able to get was the late great george peppard who played main character col john hannibal smith but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help,0
i remember the area 's twilight years in the 80 's and early 90 's,0
the other half is owned by his aunt margaret dumont,0
the production values are high and the script is very elegantly written,0
the sound and visual effects as shown on tcm are crisp and clear,0
some of the characters were so uninteresting and boorish that they could have been written out entirely and actually improve the film by shortening it,0
even though he is a married man he has no qualms having sex with various female students,0
if you 're a drinker you might just see a bit of yourself in this film,0
he gets ditched in the desert by a hick gas station attendant,0
i mean richardson and olivier,0
yes this miniseries is no remake,0
in the end this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness,0
i was sad to see the original marc be played by someone new but after i found out the guy was in the short film crush i definitely had a better impression of him,0
i personally thought this film was good,0
the only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters,0
too bad it wo n't happen,0
after 30 years of honing their unique sound it 's great to have this record of one of the most talented rock bands ever,0
well i can safely say i'm human wong,0
and william devane is in a league of his own,0
it 's discovered that a sasquatch is behind the killings and the team band together to survive,0
do you think i know a lot about the characters in this film,0
none of these setups are ever taken through to the payoff,0
then the scarecrow goes nuts and starts offing people,0
no matter how square and humorless you are at least you got some rockin' beats and mindblowing guitar riffs,0
they made me feel sick in my stomach the bunnies are gorgeous,0
i was surprised to find that ghost world is a comic book adaptation,0
how it ever acquired a rating of more than one star is beyond me,0
and for that it is worthy of attention,0
not only did i thoroughly enjoy it but so did my whole family,0
victor mclaglen is something new in cops,0
let 's not forget about how stan turns on our lead girl in about two seconds and is revealed to be a bad guy for utterly no reason along with the sheriff,0
what is the director 's game here,0
today i forced myself to sit and really watch an episode,0
maybe this is not realistic although when you read the newspaper you 'll read about much worse than this but there 's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear,0
no thrill no fx bad acting bad photography bad sound bad everything,0
that 's it folks busted furniture the only laugh in this entire film,0
the plot is pretty much a ripoff of tarantino 's film with a few scenes spoofing other often better films in the same childish and humorless fashion,0
he referred to an example of say if he ran over a dog while on his way to act in a play that it would n't be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without a doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was a light comedy,0
when hagen still refuses she decapitates him,0
talbot now cured and one of edelman 's female assistants are safe though,0
looking at it again i was shocked that i remembered so much of it,0
it 's hard to put a real drama or comedy that suits modern sensibilities on tv anymore,0
fi you want to watch a movie that does n't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it,0
except these were literally 'let 's make fun of the japanese as bizarre little benign aliens who want to become like us',0
i love to watch people make a good faith effort to make a film that other people will want to watch,0
i did have some expectations from this film because 1 it was a yash raj production 2 when the songs were first shown on tv they seemed catchy 3 the star cast was new,0
that 's right four it took an hour for me to watch it i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it,0
ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at,0
i 've seen this film three times and each time i appreciate it more,0
that 's all we need,0
this is actually a brilliant movie,0
an american in paris is a humorous lighthearted loving film well worth watching,0
yet panic in the streets remains a perfectly watchable movie mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch,0
nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the screamers print but it 's still interesting stuff and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter roger corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be,0
there is no other way of describing this other than an absolute steaming pile of festering dog turd resting on a catastrophic car pileup,0
darius is from georgia so i expect the tickets for the atlanta showing will be sold out quickly if they are not already,0
the film is wellmade but way too selfcentered to have any positive lasting message,0
as you can tell i'm not one of his fans,0
i know it 's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating but what are you going to do,0
this is one of those movies that 's trying to be moody and tense and instead ends up tripping all over itself,0
this apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of uncle shiloh 's guntoting outlaws who exploit the lawlessness of the western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who only ever drew on snakes,0
the cast is all terrific,0
though this is the plot it is not what the film is about,0
what 's to like about this movie,0
i have to stop talking or i 'll never hit the hay,0
what makes it work are the skill and charm of judi dench and ian holm,0
but to me this was a very poorly made low budget miscast movie,0
even words that can be said on network television,0
it rest firmly in the realms of the lowbudget bmovie scifi genre,0
it 's basically just getting drunk and trying to sleep with as many girls as possible,0
which would have been much more interesting,0
this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie is n't that bad,0
some of the music is quite spectacular but at other points it seems to exist in a world outside of the show,0
the viewer does n't have long to think and is suddenly thrown into a new unusual episode,0
it is graphic and heart ripping it is a movie every teen should see so that they can relay the message of never again because next time it may not be the jews it could be any culture,0
lathe of heaven is one of my favorite books and i had seen the 1980 version but i thought that it would be possible to do a newer version that would n't look so dated and low budget,0
instead it 's ultimately forgettable,0
it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society,0
the mst3k version is their best episode but it 's certainly better than the movie itself,0
there is a little more to the acting though for example asian actress anna may wong in the role of the princess' traitorous slave girl,0
1010 this was a very good royal rumble but last year 's would always top every royal rumble in history,0
also what 's with the ask whitey,0
i really enjoy the foreign settings because i feel it can take you on a trip and sometimes understand a different culture,0
i just love being confronted with disturbing depressing issues in romantic comedies,0
no it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot,0
stargate sg1 is more than just a simple scifi series it is one of the most well made interesting long running exciting scifi ever produced,0
this film is the most tasteless and disgraceful biblical film ever made,0
meanwhile we get to see also the lives of various radio performers among them mia farrow 's and wallace shawn 's characters,0
hijinks ensue and everything turns out alright in the end,0
the plot a story of redemption forgiveness and courage in the face of adversity is also very interesting and touching and it 's not predictable which is saying quite a lot about a movie in this day and age,0
so it 's not the actual creature let alone a remake,0
if it had been me i would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain,0
the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake,0
any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small identifying traits with the main character,0
so worth seeing but frustrating as a whole,0
there are some great songs in this move ya 'll,0
take the phrase let the poor lad speak,0
it 's all been done before,0
only one sequence late in the film is charged with honest feeling anger and betrayal,0
and finally there is the older man mario who is the catalyst the man who breaks emmanuelle through a series of sometimes disturbing sexual games reinventing her into the sexually liberated woman that we see in the numerous sequels,0
despite ms lohan 's troubles i do think she is talented and if only for her sake i was hoping this would be a good film,0
also the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of,0
without a hint of indulgence we see a strong character attempting to survive an experience which has shattered her life,0
his mom is a lush and the town whore,0
anyone who enjoyed this great movie is is truly a real human being,0
in this film william powell plays a man wanted for murder who has been hopping the world trying to avoid the law,0
the worst thing that can happen to a human being is death but as children we point our finger at a playmate we say bang,0
i was forced to register after watching this movie,0
charles s dutton did a marvelous job of telling a story about real life in inner cities all across america and with out holding back on the truth,0
i even miss his blist actors who are leagues better than hawke and company,0
i was also very impressed with jeremy northam,0
ahh but that ca n't happen to rich kids now can it,0
the action scenes are impressive by hollywood standards but that does n't make something good,0
there was never any need to redo it,0
i do not wish to go into the characterizations or the holes in the plot or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago when i first began watching it,0
standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of che 's last breath,0
only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie,0
everything seemed to flow together nicely both the comedy and the drama,0
dreyer is murdered before he can spill any beans but leaves a photo in a bank deposit box a more recent picture of alicia,0
wc fields 's brief role is fun though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes,0
while not truly terrible this movie is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys history,0
the kid is only likable because he is fat and ugly and you cant help but feel that he 's the type to be bullied,0
i have no idea how they were able to pull this stuff off but damn its funny and impressive,0
it is a little piece of 80s americana and worth having in your movie collection,0
good show for a night with them,0
the first grudge was an average movie at best,0
by far this is the most innovative of the whole series,0
they bond where and tell each other secrets along with evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags ben along for a country road trip,0
i am writing one now though as i may never find the movie for sale or on television so i may never get that chance,0
nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again,0
it 's also a real pity rosanna arquette 's is in this movie,0
this story of lust manipulation betrayal and revenge is not surprisingly set in the hollywood of 1995 but it 's a story that could take place elsewhere it just would n't be as captivating or beautifully photographed and there are some lovely and interesting scenes and unusual closeups,0
now i realize some elements of plot have to be there to further the story but here it is pushed to ridiculous extremes,0
okay this sure ai n't a work of art,0
this is the kind of film they used to make amusing heartwarming troubling authentic with convincing performances by people without nose jobs boob jobs eye jobs in other words real people,0
personally i'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level,0
eventually a man was arrested manuel romasanta and it was found that he used the body fat from his victims to make soap,0
i 've never seen more people smoke in one film,0
the cinematography is beautiful especially in the australian sequences,0
now i just hope they make a dvd version,0
veteran comedy film director norman z mcleod was the man in the chair for this halfhour installment,0
in contrast there are points in the film where there is no dialogue where what is not said speaks as loudly as what is or could be,0
an excellent effort by him,0
i watched it again and am not ashamed to admit i still enjoy it as much now as i did 29 years ago,0
madeleine carroll plays princess flavia who is slated to marry the king,0
there is also no real romance here either,0
there is also the terrible hunchback crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments,0
it is one of the very few movies i have watched to its conclusion despite my deepest desire to stop the pain of watching it,0
speaking of the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes,0
perhaps he 's saying something about communication,0
i must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people some english some european and some american and while some of us loved it some hated it and found it worthless,0
this movie is pure of heart,0
throughout the plot the characters chase each other like a cat and mouse with several key events leading the film 's direction in the wrong way,0
it gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die,0
it 's fairly disgusting as it studies some weird necrophiliac fantasies and the story is interesting but it becomes a bit muddled as it goes through and is ultimately forgettable,0
if you payed attention earlier on you saw jeremy 's stepfather allen in a bumped up mercedes,0
however had it starred bela lugosi i honestly believe might have been an alltime classic,0
i hope so because at least that idea is funny,0
the cast are all very good in their roles especially francis lederer 's portrayal of claude,0
i do n't anything about her mother which makes the impression that she did not have a mother or who is actually her father,0
it 's mostly because of brad pitt 's performance,0
set in a futuristic world where there are colonies throughout the entire solar system cowboy bebop tells the stories of the bounty hunters or cowboys that reside upon the ship the cowboy bebop,0
as carol natalie wood at thirty never looked so sexy nor come across so relaxed on screen,0
the only optimistic thing you can say about the film is that the girl playing the leading part could buy a simple house for her and her family after having played in the film,0
but some ask what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use,0
but however it kept my attention for the whole running time,0
i'm a movie buff have over 2000 dvds in my collection,0
my rating 77 out of 10 feel free for mailing me about any of my comments and posts here,0
any sequel following a romero film that 's not directed by romero himself has got some large shoes to fill mostly because of the romero fans out there who think he 's god,0
not forgetting others in minor roles,0
to what purpose she was brought back i have no clue,0
which is scary as hell considering the world they 're in,0
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing,0
who said yes to this project in the first place,0
it 's also worth noting that richard casey did n't go for that old slasher chestnut of having a cast full of pretty boys and page 3 girls to dismember,0
really ca n't say enough about this film except that it 's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this does n't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does,0
only the third part is based on the short story the copulating mermaid of venice california by charles bukowski,0
straight up kill bill is one of the biggest disappointments i have seen in my life,0
a fairy tale for today 's grownups,0
that 's how they usually solve it,0
santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour,0
i love the charlie 's angels just like you do,0
the story concludes as best as possible with blondell taking a fast exit back to nebraska,0
she also delivers the film 's only nudity in the pleasure chamber section of the film,0
in bollywood we really do need more directors like nagesh kukunoor who have the guts to make different movies,0
even the villains in the film seem to realize what they have done and they suddenly go from being characters to hate to just people playing their role in the urban jungle,0
i 'd read the reviews here and most of them do mention that this has low production values but saying this really does n't capture the atrocity of mulva,0
the second cinderella was cute but lacked originality and seemed lacklustre in quality,0
he reminds me of an oriental mix of deniro and keitel,0
all by a guy with a scalpel and surgical dress on,0
i do n't think norma went mad because hollywood turned its back on her rather hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad,0
does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie,0
the only characters in the film who are not total morons from the beginning are john malkovich and his wife tilda swinton,0
if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i 'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours,0
she says the crazy man annoyed the brother but he says he does n't know anything about the man,0
i do n't need hollywood to show me that roger maris and mickey mantle were human beings with human frailties,0
the second story is cut by chanwook park,0
at times it 's boring and some scenes drag on for far too long but it has it 's moments,0
with its many substories that probably did not happen but as far as dr john harvey kellogg and the battle creek san was concerned it is fairly accurate,0
it shows how positive energy is released while using the word fck,0
stay during the credits there are some pretty funny moments,0
a company called pandora corporation,0
this though is not one of them,0
strange world we live in 310,0
you ask how could you even get as far as the credits and then watch them,0
there are some moments that do work but they are in a minority,0
i knew it would n't the promos said it all,0
it 's now 1950 reunion time,0
leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress,0
the plot is ridiculous there are only 2 characters and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief,0
which of course involve this little kid in a rain slicker,0
by todays standards the film is pretty tame,0
absurd theater and pantomime never work on screen,0
there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the character 's are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat,0
this should be required viewing for all high school students,0
it 's in the top 250 at imdb,0
you know the kind of performances that make your children 's high school play look like one flew over the cuckoo 's nest part deux,0
all in all it 's a pretty poorly written script,0
even julian sands 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie,0
why does it take the bailiff so many years to track them down,0
komodo vs cobra is not going to set the world on fire,0
hugh grant is perfect in the role of a typical british man and symbol of a hypocrite society,0
did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo,0
i ca n't believe how bad this movie is,0
and that includes episodes 59 which are hard to beat on the unwatchable meter,0
there were also subtle problems such as some of the film was not properly edited to make it feel like it fit in the movie as the lighting was off and it seemed the purpose of it was to purely drag the film on,0
i would watch this movie every time it was on cable and it never got old,0
ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite,0
i first caught this movie when it aired on cw a few months ago,0
this cannot be classified as entertainment,0
miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this,0
through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget,0
the film begins with married genevieve tobin trying to arrange a tryst with george brent,0
though intriguing sop does n't really benefit from the big screen treatment and would probably have just as much impact if viewed on tv,0
that 's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie,0
and yet he giggles and wraps his arms around his buddy 's waist as they merrily stroll off,0
the idea looked good on paper,0
the mental conflict makes for a fascinating story line as well as a riveting performance by robert shaw and a jawdropping characterization of a sun god by christopher plummer,0
one thing that bugged me was the black santa,0
you feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie,0
the whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sitcom one bit,0
it 's better than a lot of other lowbudget flicks and even some bigbudget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts,0
the cast delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic european accent so common to bad epics,0
this time louis gossett jr returns to whip new american and russian recruits in line to prepare them for a mission against middle eastern terrorists who have gotten a nuclear launching site of course the mission is meant to fail but in the heat of it all heroism prevails over the differences of the soldiers in question,0
grant is richard nugent an artist who gets into some trouble and comes before judge turner,0
to be honest it was hilariously bad and something i 'd expect from a midnight showing of a madefortv b grade scifi channel movie,0
aside from the audience few really find out the truth about the man usually to their demise,0
they do n't make such high quality films anymore where it 's character driven,0
i first seen it when i was six then i bought it recently and i still love it im 15 now,0
this film appears a bit forced the directing lacks substance and oh yeah the music is ridiculously awful it did n't put me in a very good mood,0
i loved the animated series and even batman beyond,0
this is an awful film,0
the director also did a pretty good job,0
it seems that the people behind envy realised that recent comedies especially ones involving ben stiller and to a lesser degree jack black have been situation spoofs which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs,0
the twins finishing each other 's sentences was not cute it showed a lack of material for them,0
so i'm sitting there saying to myself wow,0
strong precode film has strong dialogue stanwyck and joan blondell in their underwear alcoholism nymphomania attempted rape child abuse and clark gable slugging stanwyck unconscious,0
it 's the sort of scene that gives gay cinema a very bad name,0
caught this feature at the stony brook film festival last night,0
annie pushed archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the englishman 's world stage not as himself but grey owl an canadian native of the wilderness frontier,0
plain and simple bad it 's not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it,0
both of whom betrayed her and lied on the stand simply because they were angry that she had chosen to love another woman,0
a few teenagers go in almost everyone dies that 's it that 's the whole story right there,0
there are few things worse than art that wants to appear so hip that it 's above it all,0
i did n't just give it a ten because bill hicks is godlike no sir,0
many of the characters go through complete transformations throughout the course of the movie and we get to witness this firsthand,0
ranbir kapoor and sonam kapoor are perfectly cast as the misguided lovers and salman khan is finally playing a character who seems to read deep into his soul and bring out the sultry quality that he so naturally possesses,0
like other reviewers have mentioned it is so bad that it is funny,0
i love sarah waters 's fingersmith and was worried about the tv adaptation as i 'd been disappointed by the bbc 's version of tipping the velvet,0
bottom line this one 's not worth your time,0
words cannot express how poor this film is,0
definition of donkey punch a mediocre film trying desperately to make itself memorable by basing things around one scene that will stick in your mind for a while,0
it is obvious that the secretary is attracted to the boss just look at her staring at him in his bedroom and she does n't seem so drunk as he is,0
it 's when both andre and wally begin to exchange opinions later in the movie andre did most of the talking during the first half that the two make contact with each other and draw the audience into their conversation,0
but their problems have only begun,0
although it is packed with action the acting seems a little fake and the direction seems somewhat lost throughout the film without a strong defining characters and conflicts as one action sequence blends into another,0
despite the name of the movie and the cover this is not a zombie movie,0
this is a dark dark tale which should be highlighted by dim lighting but this remake seemed not only to fail in this but seemed to go in the opposite direction,0
i do not recommend this movie,0
there are other bits pieces that i did n't understand either like the 'dead' body rosy shows marvin under the drain cover at the start yet even though he takes photos of it it never mentioned or seen again maybe i did miss something i do n't know,0
throughout the movie malkovich talks to eastwood as if they are friends,0
but whilst these moments are undeniably yucky they are n't particularly convincing and soon get rather tedious,0
farewell to the flesh was by far the best one of the series as it explained the story behind candyman very thoroughly,0
and does he think he is brian de palma with using all those redundant and completely pointless splitscreen shots that do n't add anything at all,0
i think the people who just reject this film out of hand should really rent american pimp or some other documentary on prostitution,0
if it were found the fact that it was on his return route would be pretty incriminating,0
much to my dismay i ended up watching a predictable movie that has been done at least a dozen times before,0
the military no longer accepts people in lieu of prison time,0
the women in this film are mostly gorgeous and great to look at naked,0
the outside world was suspended for a moment,0
in a bug 's life the help comes in the form of a downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a barroom brawl,0
also he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent movies,0
if you can find anything at all better to watch i would n't recommend this one,0
unfortunately i thought the movie was terrible and i'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie,0
all the child actors in this movie male and female are talented and attractive,0
blog on films and books,0
again they could 've slipped by without any of this but it just makes things that much better,0
some movies just should not even be available for the safety of the public 's sanity,0
the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts,0
it 's hard to put your finger on this one,0
1 giant leap was nominated for two academy awards in 2003 and should have won,0
and that one 's not mean to be funny but man is it well done overall to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time if you ever see this movie get it,0
thats about all i liked in it though,0
the writing the voice acting even the claymation,0
these days asian horror films are among the best in the world noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society,0
nothing new or interesting happens so you ca n't even call the film daring or interesting,0
it should be very funny and entertaining,0
i am a jack arnold fan,0
in only one can i find a difference,0
hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest ernst rohm,0
mucho daft but for the longest time i thought she was the bad guy so a good job in the writing with that,0
if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you 'll find this movie entertaining but if you 're not do n't waste your time you 'll regret it in the long run,0
so the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size but also because of the tie to the greatest conquerer the world has ever known,0
and that 's just an example this sort of things goes on through out the whole series,0
unfortunately the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of jhorror,0
i actually registered here for the sole purpose of expressing my resentment at having wasted 20 bucks and 3 hours on such nonsense,0
this is an offbeat yet charming feminist comedy with a deft dialogue and great photography,0
i have since watched this movie several times,0
characters inexplicably will not keep the camera still,0
i was so annoyed by all the lame jokes i forgot,0
you will either view billy as an annoying disgusting idiot who uses grim like a toy or you will view him as one of the funnier characters of the show,0
if you 're young and have a thing for interesting stories you 'll love this one,0
show boat is one of those garish musicals from the 1950s where scope and spectacle dwarfed content and story,0
and its not even the big fight at the end,0
now why on earth will mexico support a movie like this,0
the road to el dorado seems to overdo its attempt to involve adults in the movie by sacrificing its innocence,0
and through this entire movie these people were getting into situations that they could have easily called the police on,0
once more the dogs are the only actors that seem real and thats a stretch,0
for whatever reasons the film was given to the main distributors who editing out half the original film and then edited in the most random scenes ever,0
last week those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the senior oscar winner in attendance luise rainer,0
finally she did n't hear any noise for almost two hours and when she went to check and see if he had died in his chair or something she found him concentrating on a book that he had in his hand and the book was the shining,0
this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before,0
michael douglas as a good ol' boy now there 's a new one,0
the full blown finale defies description,0
let 's start by saying my three star rating of this film is an act of generosity on my part considering it is n't a bad action film has some exciting sequences and thrilling moments,0
the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing,0
for a great many viewers the best thing about the film will be the cute and cuddly dogs that perform various tricks their training is easily more impressive than the humdrum story based on a hopefully more consequential lois duncan book,0
the upside to being a bad actor in america is that that the movie industry is structured as a business,0
the basic premise seems okay but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous and runs out half way through,0
he can cock an eyebrow but he 's as bland as como,0
although i have not read the story i believe this must be blasphemy to it 's original intent,0
i was beside myself with glee when i first heard of this movie,0
oh look at him raise his brow and cock his head at a jaunty angle,0

within the first few minutes i realised i 'd ordered a b grader but was still full of expectation,0
i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back,0
this is n't a terrible episode but i thought it was a particularly generic and boring entry in the series,0
they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it,0
anne heche as marion crane does a creditable job but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh,0
with actors culled from the original offbroadway cast it casts and even deeper gloom over the film,0
i bought this movie based on some other reviews i 'd read,0
but the finished product was a treat with a terrific cliffhanger at the end of episode one which was n't immediately spoiled in the next time trailer,0
des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star,0
unfortunately you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun,0
the screenplay of this movie completely ignored known facts at that time,0
if you have n't seen the movie please stop reading here,0
the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid,0
this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time,0
and its still one of my favorites,0
and for a movie so full of sex this is about the least erotic thing i can imagine,0
it is one of the most haunting beautiful and chilling movies i have ever seen,0
i also felt that ang lee selected the right actress,0
so unless you get the context it 's entirely useless as bankable humor,0
this movie had some good acting and realistic dialogue but the story line was bad,0
an intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered,0
the script was too bland,0
the amazing mr no legs is a totally demented in idea as well as execution exploitation feature with a premise that is unique and refreshing and production values looking so cheap and amateurish that you simply have to show admiration for the cast and crew,0

critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them,0
is it all just about getting awards ie,0
the dvds of the episodes are provided weekly with a greek newspaper in greece,0
the music in wonderful and memorable,0

since this movie shows that happen i was n't disappointed,0
uh okay i am going too deep,0
cough cough i think there might be a gas leak,0
very funny film for all the wrong reasons,0
however this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery both visual and in the script that you were practically hammered over the head with,0
those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin,0
i'm sorry but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours,0
i probably could have combined those last two sentences,0
the acting in this movie is above standard for the most part but it just ca n't help this sleeper of a movie,0
not to take any credit away from this movie i think it was n't all that horrible or even shocking,0
mom is a divorcee who apparently gets no child support and manages her money so poorly she has let her house mortgage build up to over 3000,0
tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act,0

he lands the plane and joins the girl on her way to detroit,0
i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie,0
the film takes in themes of patriotism vigilantism and vengeance and fuses it with a thriller narrative,0
anyway you wo n't be disappointed here,0
the film transcends the time it was made the action takes place during the second world war,0
they are in no way pornographic as i have heard people say,0

the acting is generally very unconvincing still bai ling and alec newman are more or less ok most of the time,0
i give it a 4 higher than it deserves but always hopeful that a poor effort will draw attention by someone who is up to telling the story intelligently,0
it destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally welldone first act,0
more suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed,0
bette davis does an exceptional job playing an extremely manipulative woman who repeatedly overplays her hand,0
what if you were someone else 's dream,0
altogether this movie does n't quite fall flat in the way a 110 movie would,0
the movie has some good points to make and occasionally does so effectively but the overall distortion low quality lack of narration and complete lack of a sense of humor bring this one down,0
do n't get me wrong,0
never in the history of tv has a series been this gripping this entertaining heartwarming and exciting and above all original as the amazing race,0
this is as thrilling and convincing as a republican convention no sorry watching the republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie,0
although it 's a pretty glum and straightforward thing to say that nothing lasts the film does not depict itself through false optimism but rather through hope,0
instead of focusing on plots why not focus on story,0
i particularly liked the technique of going back in the story to fill in the gaps of the storyline,0
i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday,0
the movie surprisingly failed at the box office,0
it is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman,0

this is not enough however as the story line is too simplistic and expected and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place i kept asking myself all over the picture whether i am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and scriptwriter wanted or about the innocent kid who is in the middle,0
the basic story is about a flamboyant over the top new assassin hoping to take over number 1 spot held by a disciplined introspective killer,0

i did n't know her,0
i give this movie 1010,0

because there is a lot of voiceover work,0
of course there 's a bit more to it than that there is a plot kinda,0
well worth the watch though,0

during an argument she smashed a bottle over his head and is now almost sure that he died as a result,0

when preppy tv station producer michael comes to town to convince dick to star in a weekly vermont today series he and stephanie hit it off and the series launches into full steam,0

from around the time europe began fighting world war ii until the war 's end hollywood made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the army by making the life of a serviceman appear cool,0
the climax is so overblown it 's amusingly bad,0
i ca n't say how closely the film follows the novel never having read the book but since this clocks in at some six and a half hours it 's a good bet that most of the base are covered or at least we can say with some certainty that this is n't a reader 's digest condensed version,0
he spends his time getting plastered,0
the filmmaking is neither this nor that,0

i knew i was in trouble five minutes into the film when it just did n't feel right,0
it is disturbing i give it that,0
nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood sentimental in its treatment of the director this documentary is an absolute mustsee for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day,0
i have n't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me,0
the gloves take away a lot of the blow so no cats got harmed during the making of this motion picture and actually seeing cats fight on the streets with their claws is of course something far more violent and violent looking even though it 's just nature unlike obviously putting gloves on a couple of cats and let them fight in a small boxing ring,0
i bought this movie not hoping to find great directing or acting,0
that is a twentysomething guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother,0

the definition of pedophile does n't have to include many children all you need is one,0
clearly certain events portrayed identify the main protagonist as the dublin criminal known as the general but almost everything else is just wrong,0
but at the same time if one were to look objectively bratz 's message is a little scrambled and quite off in any positive aspect,0
i really hoped for the best with this one but it just did n't happen,0
the landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation are undercooked and certainly didnt help move the plot any further,0
what is the purpose of any documentary,0
woodrow was a man that could not express his feelings and kept them bottled up,0
the general public 's opinions never cease to amaze me,0
directors must make tough choices,0
the script itself is dreadful,0
she too played a similar role in come and get it to far stronger effect,0
this movie is so complex,0
o 'shea is fine in the part but certainly was no box office,0
it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns,0

please someone one with a tempered style remake this movie,0
it 's sweet funny and warms your heart,0

no family wants to be exploited and this family certainly would provide more than enough of such material,0

why has this been such a huge hit in 1986,0
i wish i 'd been afraid to see it,0
i do n't know whether to love or to hate this movie because despite it being a obvious ripoff or omen to the texas chainsaw massacre it was n't all that bad,0
it seemed to be several clips from steve 's animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script,0
the script contains plenty of surprises,0
it 's a good story well told,0
thus in parts it 's got its qualities,0
mishima falls into the latter category,0
do n't watch this movie and do n't be fooled by the 54 rating because it obviously overrated and does n't deserve anything above 2,0
the plot is fastmoving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places,0
the high point was fawcett 's nude scenes but the movie would n't even let us have that without showing kirk douglas 's old man butt,0
i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations,0
in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 1520 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area,0
bottom line for all of you is that this movie is not going to make the grade,0
there 's one decapitation scene in particular that far exceeds the quality of anything else in vengeance of the zombies,0
they 're just in it to pick up a paycheck and do n't seem very intent on giving it their all,0
it was n't just the photography and haden the entire cast was fascinating and it 's simply a fastmoving entertaining film,0

who though of robson 's gum transplant,0
that 's one of its more appealing themes,0

coming of age movies are quite usual these days,0
when he sees the poster 's calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man,0
during the entire movie i waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked why was she fighting who did she love and trust,0
the supporting cast of oscar levant georges guetary and nina foch are at the top of their form,0
but the real reason to watch the movie if your a motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett 's film legacy,0
likewise two strangers falling over and getting entangled just as the ugly party 's wife or husband appears a tedious clich and there 's a lot of it here,0
the soundtrack by tom waits literally carries the weight of the movie and guides the action,0
no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it,0
but do n't leave without reading the last sentence of my review,0
i could n't believe how well he played the part,0
if perhaps the filmmakers had reedited the movie and called the movie skydiving and lots of it,0
so all in all this was a long series,0
and hepburn 's disguise as a boy fools everyone in the film but no one in the audience,0
this stylized notion of organized crime being too influential and powerful to overcome has become a standard component in every gangster picture,0
for the real thing take yourself to your local multiplex and show peter jackson what a great job he did with lord of the rings,0
she is a singer in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character,0
if you are a fan of the original highlander and for some reason have n't seen this yet for pity 's sake do n't,0
some viewers especially the younger ones cannot appreciate how actresses have developed over the lifetime of moviemaking,0
i think this movie would have to be watched as an education piece,0
plus why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it,0
in jackson 's version of the fellowship of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty inn beds is almost a complete carbon copy of the scene in bakshi 's film shot by shot,0
melodies are hard to compose so let 's listen to rap,0
as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing,0
he knows that something is different about him something mysteriously evil,0
in short it 's an exceptional thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat by providing interesting characters with many levels and never truly revealing what 's happening while throwing in many twists and surprises to upset completely what you 've just seen,0
wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people,0
there seemed to be a lacking of logic in the way the soldiers and pilots carried out their missions,0
i have begun a campaign to get it re released i kid you not,0
after their friendly encounter with the town 's folk no sane person would have gone back they should 've just walked on,0
just the way bunuel would have wanted it,0
the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes,0
it is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a subpar movie,0
rest assured there are plenty more moments of unintentional hilarity but these you must discover for yourself,0
however this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one,0
no charisma no talent and i do n't see why people consider her pretty the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that katrina 's character was remotely attracted to govinda,0
it sure does n't move quickly,0
ray liotta is a vicious criminal without redeeming characteristics,0
the bonus disc is really about a 9 but the fact that you have to buy it in this set at the moment dramatically reduces it 's rating,0
so if you are still reading let us explain who we are,0
in the real world partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive because in good relationships partners support the longterm goals of their sig others,0
the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy shaky camerawork and the fast confusing cutting,0
i think beatty 's traumatic shock afterward was well done,0
i 've gotta say i have seen better acting in a porno,0
i got this one a few weeks ago and love it,0
this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead,0
the real exception is the black cat where karloff is playing the evil head of a devil cult and lugosi is seeking revenge on him for destroying his life,0
i also want to know what it all means,0
it should have been one or the other but it failed at both,0
gasps a general as a dozen native zombies wander around the battlefields of europe during the great war,0
it could be considered a documentary,0
geraldine fitzgerald is pure vixen as the third member of the trio a woman so consumed by jealousy and obsessed with the supposed powers of the goddess kwan yin that she has ceased being influenced by natural love affection,0
ca n't the writers makeup their minds,0
it truly felt like ten minutes,0
i liked most of his works for they are smart,0
the film lumps together elements borrowed from lassie rin tin tin the littlest hobo skippy the bush kangaroo and many more and then gleefully turns them all on their head in a brilliant parody,0
this combination between the action thriller and comedy was done so many times before but not with a personality like eugene levy,0

down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals,0
charley begins to like anne and viceversa except that she is very big on monogamy in the men in her life and they decide to give it a shot two weeks of faithfulness,0
and there are so many very talented people in the industry,0
i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing and by further development i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future,0
i have wanted to see this film since i went on a sixth grade field trip to see a play based on this film,0
who got her father convicted is determined to get barrie and her gang,0
scorpion 's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose,0
all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it 's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality,0
this is completely true and as if to prove this fact girls are for loving removes the sadism rape and nubile young flesh completely and is half hearted at best about bondage,0
so in summary do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this,0
but tupac had a lot to say but just did n't have it figured out he was a little confused,0
this is a movie that i think will do better on video than it will in theaters though i 'd encourage people to go see it,0

this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing,0
this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it 's over before it 's begun,0
although they are married in real life they lack chemistry on the screen,0
i read the book afterward and noted a number of differences from the tv show but felt the show still stands as a brilliant entertainment in its own right,0
to do a remake is simply inexcusable,0
the special effects are terrible,0
i saw this movie for the first time in an old small town movie house in big spring texas back in 1978 seeing the film where i did is one reason i will never forget it,0

we 're never really sure if what we 're seeing is actually happening,0
and they call women whiny,0
a priceless piece of entertainment showcase for a lot of talented comics who did not necessarily have substantial film careers,0
but the picture was blurry and was presented in the same 169 ratio i could get at home instead of the wider ratio many films come in these days,0
and that 's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of the tempest,0
there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls,0
clampett had hit his stride as a director by this point and while it is n't anywhere near his best work it 's nothing to sneeze at either,0
the roaches have gone killer and this very strange research lady is in town to study them,0
sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you 're not making a comedy and you 're really just shoving your political views on other people,0
i read a book several years ago about sexual abuse in the scouting movement,0
on its own its not that bad,0
it wasnt even dumb behaviour that was there too but the pure idiocy of the script transcended any dumbness the characters displayed,0
granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but it 's still a damn sight better than 99 of direct to video dross,0
please save yourself the pain and rent something else,0
to the movie 's credit the imdb user who said that the plot was implausible the sad truth is that it 's totally plausible that that exact thing is going on in laurel canyon right now,0
just wait until it 's shown on tv as you might find yourself looking for the remote after 1520 minutes,0
why benoit was wrestling jordan the worst us champ in history is beyond me,0
the thunder may be closer than you think,0
so leos carax has to changed and he did,0
frankly the tv show had better writing not to mention better cinematography,0
i am not a massive coen fan so this film did not appeal to me as it did to many other people,0
a number of reviewers seemed to be blown away by this movie,0
you have got to admire a movie that sets and then surpasses its own goals,0
one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in,0
i have one word focus,0
i think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell,0
i have found that going back to the time of imagination and innocents with my little girl has given me some relief from my many stresses,0
whereas this has to be seen it is so over the top and out of place it 's like a shock,0
maybe if you 're a casual tv watcher and do n't know good writing or story lines then you will love this show and think all of the pop culture references are funny,0
if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film,0
i think you will enjoy it if you enjoy a good psychological study,0
however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile three or four times,0
the chemistry between the four best friends could be better but considering it 's only the first few episodes chemistry can be developed over time,0
i do n't care who is playing the part and why nuns ca n't in my view be seen as funny,0
and even though i have called this a sequel i do not recognise it as such,0
especially the good old chills,0
so it makes sense that the neighborhood is a little empty as most people would probably go elsewhere until the killer is caught,0
well played andrew kevin walker the boy done good,0
you cannot help but enjoy the movie as danny aiello once again plays a tough italian father who tries to hold on,0
this is my favorite movie ever,0
otherwise i 'd say skip it,0
denzel does an excellent job as do the writers,0
i 've seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i do n't get the good reviews here,0
the story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it 's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero,0
this is by far the worst movie ever,0
not that there was a british vs american issue about it,0
because it 's a great movie,0
common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge,0
almost all of the movie takes place in an old time bathhouse with the denizens supplying the humor pathos and emotional touches,0
this one is n't even lively enough to be fun,0
it does n't surpass the level of those cheap '' based on true stories '' movies or anything inspired by the books of danielle steel,0
later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary and she got me and my nephew into a vip,0
as nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that do n't make any sense,0
if russia wants its own birth of a nation it should at least make its racist epic a better movie,0
it has actual sex scenes involving said,0
i could n't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script,0
she beautifully portrays a woman who has become fed up with her live yet can move on without bitterness,0
one of the absolute favorites is herbert walton as old charlie who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film,0
the character 's are a bit clichd the weak man the bent lawyer the protective mum the young tart who has sex to get what she wants but they all serve their purpose well enough the dialogue is ok the story moves along at a nice pace overall i liked right to die apart from a few minutes here there where it loses it 's focus a bit i was n't that keen on the ambiguous ending,0
i honestly do n't think queen of the damned lends itself to a movie very well,0
raisuli the english have paid very well in the past,0
it 's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity,0
i was beginning to think i was the only person who remembered this movie and am pleased to know i am not alone,0
for me there 's no question about it this movie deserves an a for effort but a d for execution,0
at least there are some goodlooking stereotyped kids thrown into the mix this time camping at the lake at the worst possible time,0
guilty is the wrong word for it though as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time,0
he is getting older and i think still has some good movies to do in him,0
this is his most violent movie yet,0
i have loved this movie all of my life,0
prince mauch invites pauper mauch over to the palace where the two become intrigued by their different lifestyles and identical appearance,0
this film has been remade into other less distinguished movies and a musical play without the charm or elegance of mr lubitsch 's own and definite version,0
i knew nothing of the film before i saw it and i really did hope for something enjoyable enlightening what have you but i was disappointed,0
what can i say but oh my gods,0
i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying i know daddy but i hurt so much inside after leslie dies,0
or maybe not if you look at his career for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits,0
not wanting to leave her husband 's side mrs strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the titanic,0
i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china,0
but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre,0
nice ensemble types with great performances by all,0
the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment is somewhat interesting,0
i usually do n't bring many expectations to the table,0
the acting is lame but then perry has always been laid back,0
pretty standard film all in all that really has not much new to offer if you do n't have anything better to do you might as well watch this,0
why are democrats given such a free pass in this film,0
for example a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc,0
i was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed i was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his,0
the book is one of the most cherished works in the english language,0
on the other hand they also add a feel good and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place,0
i saw it at an advance screening almost two years ago and just about fell out of my chair laughing,0
otherwise some pretty stupid characters a few decent explosions and a lot of running around,0
while at school micheal receives a warning in the shape of yet another vision a warning which tells him christy will be the next to die micheal must try save christy his remaining friends who were present at the sance before this unknown source of evil kills all of them this mexican american coproduction was written directed by ruben galindo as ruben galindo jr is one seriously bad film,0
a lot of laughs for all the wrong reasons,0
you will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners and gannon 's gang,0
the story is laughable and must have been written during a bad acid trip,0
no offence to richard e grant but his manic nervy edgy style was completely wrong from the beginning,0
this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight,0
it 's not exactly a major shock that boris karloff plays a mad scientist in this film though it is very unusual the way he plays this role,0
have you noticed dear indians,0
even warren hymer as the cop is rather good,0
if you 're looking for real comedy and humor this is the movie to watch,0
farhan akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus has created characters that the youth in india can relate to,0
and stiggs appeared in national lampoon and it was both uproariously funny and outrageously offensive to both genders all races and all sexual preferences,0
so while i liked reading the other reviews i was perplexed by the great cast comments,0
put generously the film can be described as nothing more than an abysmal painful retreat of just about the worst possible amalgamation of romantic comedy clichs and failed slapstick gags which consistently fall flat,0
they could n't have made a better movie,0
that said there 's a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers,0
the script is enjoyable to an extent and there are no issues as far as acting goes,0
i will not give away more but i am sure that most of my fellow poliziotteschi fans will enjoy the film as much as i did,0
however if you find a dvd of this movie buy it and watch it,0
it does a perfect job of making you slightly nervous and anxious at the same time,0
their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic,0
of course changes had to be made to adapt it to tv the budget and make it accessible to new viewers,0
i saw friends in the 70 's when it was first released,0
i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression,0
a wide variety of people stuck on a island,0
want to watch it and love it,0
more likely you hated it too but in some malicious disturbed form of sadism you need others to suffer too,0
here he is ready to kill again now as a snow man with cooler powers,0
but for anyone who 's into older movies sylvia kristel or sex i so suggest you watch emmanuelle,0
this is definitely one of the bad ones,0
he 's buddy has been transformed into a motorcycle,0
it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes,0
the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men,0
there was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other,0
it did n't feel good,0
thank goodness he has grown up,0
meanwhile a young female reporter tries to get the scoop on dirk 's past,0
they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots,0
the look and feel of the film is perfect,0
this movie is no oscar winner but definitely entertaining,0
i was very disappointed that one of my favorite actors comes off in a very unfavorable light,0
my roommate in college dragged me to this piece of crap and i'm ashamed to say i actually paid top dollar to see it,0
or erica who at 4 12 feet is a giant,0
a beautifully photographed and paced short film,0
it is one of my ten favorite comedies of all time,0
the two people who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously,0
outside of that the film is thoughtprovoking and for all its minor flaws quite realistic,0
as hartley jokingly said in his introduction to the film at tiff the film has lots of exposition and explanations,0
that 's the type of humor to expect from this very enjoyable nonsensical screwball comedy the year of the awful truth topper and nothing sacred as well as duds like true confession and double wedding,0
not to mention that she was nine years old when she first got to mansfield,0
technically glenville 4 it does n't really require the viewer to have seen the others except maybe part 3 but even part 3 opens with an epilogue from part 2 oh never mind,0
i think i made it through about half of this movie,0
i did n't quite get the ending but the girls were hot especially that bianca lawson chick she 's pretty hot,0
it did i mention that it 's bad,0
you will suffer along with each person who is sacrificed so that others may live,0
it drags on and on with silly revelations and preposterous situations,0
a sense of pace can be portrayed by other means,0
the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend,0
there is another company that puts out a dvd which is better quality but apparently while the overall quality is better the version of the dentist is censored has cheezy music added in,0
of the greatest importance was the different cultural and social uses of one word that has so much power,0
what 's not to like,0
the music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it heralds failure or death,0
and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again,0
she is so droll and nononsense you 'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys,0
basically the lodge is just another runofthemill horror flick where you have 1 a desolate location 2 some good looking young adults 3 a subpar story 4 even more subpar acting and 5 the feeling that you do n't particularly care who survives,0
sam neill and john rhys davies appear to give powerful performances as norman dogs people not so much afraid for the good but rather absorbed by savage brutality,0
like other movies from the worst director ever ed wood this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny,0
he just does n't get it,0
it was a wonderful movie and cast,0
not even great special effects can save this film,0
ok their relationship is n't quite working out we get it,0
pretty slow going but hang in there for the werewolf versus vampires,0
keith cooke is an impressive kicker gary daniels is an excellent opponent and the cast is obviously full of real fighters,0
but if you like to see a good european movie you should not miss this,0
he 's a man looking for selfrespect but he ca n't find any he 's ridden to success on the talents of day 's ruth etting so he tries to demand it from everybody else,0
it was one of those movies that was so bad it was good,0
it 's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread,0
the homicide hall of fame turns up,0
after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him,0
the only good character is 7,0
i consider myself a relatively big fan of the giallo genre though i have n't seen nearly as many as some that i talk too but i figure at this point i 've seen enough to separate the notable entries from the weaker ones and who saw her die,0
what would my personal horror be,0
since i post at very few days boards i would really appreciate it if many drake fans from here could take this text and start a thread about this campaign on one of the message boards that you all frequent,0
meanwhile good character actors handle themselves convincingly,0
the plot is one of those bumper car episodes the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot,0
this movie is designed for an illiterate superstitious audience,0
every single thing about murder game was bad i cannot think of one thing that was remotely good about this film,0
the kid grows long golden curls and looks ever more like a girl which makes me think of a good reason why the knight kept him around so long,0
the film tries to inject originality and a message into it 's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror,0
air force one is nonstop action with a mixture of the hit tv show west wing,0
i love the serious look that he 's got going on,0
i never once felt scared,0
the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made,0
anyhow if you stumble across this review somehow because one of your friends read the book and loved it or saw the movie and are recommending that you see it take my advice and watch it,0
as for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a dc comics strip,0
and he 's on a horse,0
joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out,0
i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie,0
personally i did n't think much of the wraith although it 's just about daft enough to have a certain charm maybe have a few admirers,0
i was embarrassed to be watching this movie in public,0
i really did n't care how it finished,0
then the frogs once again appeal to jupiter who states the obvious moral that it 's best to be happy with what you have,0
the main quest for bunuel is to question the morality of the characters,0
to me there are lots of worse movies in all categories,0
this movie despite what you might hear was not made for nothing,0
writing about a movie such as this being a stroke of genius is just one of many ways some people deal with an inferiority complex,0
not to mention the pacing is agonizingly slow and the dialogue is terrible and each story is just plain boring,0
what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing,0
i ca n't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold,0
actually he 's all right,0
like braveheart to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical,0
i 've always been a fan of this particular agatha christie book and from what i remember the movie is as faithful to christie 's source material as any of the poirot installments,0
this movie is really genuine and random,0
the unrelenting grimness is even reflected in their sexual encounters with a succession of squalid and unsatisfying relationships,0
this series has to be the worst possible anime i 've ever seen in a while,0
everyone else is just watching it to tide them over until the next scream sequel comes out and for that reason they will be disappointed,0
in other words the movie is watchable but only if you know how to use your fastforward button,0
i just was n't always sure if the film had anything more to say than john lennon ruled and richard nixon sucked,0
for that i was n't disappointed,0
no one is intentionally trying to break families up or ruin lives,0
lee and his work fall into the latter he does not have the touch to do effective satire because he is too close to the subject matter,0
i understand that suspension of belief is a requirement of scifi fans but you have to limit it to just what is necessary to tell the story you are trying to tell,0
some movies go to video quickly because they are n't that good,0
it not only shows good versus evil it has such grand themes as science versus nature and a meditation on the religious right that is often over looked by the more carefree viewer,0
given the tone and level of the work today i will bet on this film,0
charlize theron and susan sarandon with a solid cast bring home the horror of iraq in a film that is today 's war in the middle east,0
this movie is also great as it 's dialogue is good,0
as a movie the plot made little if any sense,0
i play it every year as a tradition and i do n't regret spending my time on it,0
when flynn played a dramatic part he seemed forced and uncomfortable,0
now after that first part is over one might think that kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning,0
without spoiling so much of course there is a red herring and a twist,0
they made that too much of a focus of the movie,0
i did n't see the third story because i was falling asleep by then and turned the tv off,0
the fact is that there are no volcanoes in los angeles,0
the film is hard on the nerves to watch as all depictions of depravity and death are,0
you 'll probably be so bored after awhile you 'll be begging for the psycho hick family to start the killing already,0
they are n't sure if she was the one who murdered the others or if she just panicked and killed the rescuer because of her mental condition following the massacre of her scantilyclad friends,0
the ridiculous closeups of the killers eyes are more funny than anything,0
this is not war this is total war,0
women too may have similar thoughts but all such considerations must be pushed out of one 's conscious mind,0
he 's ok as dracula but much better as the wolf man,0
hans will return as a nazi officer and he 'll be the force that destroys the happiness of this trio and who at the end has to pay for the horrible things he did in his youth,0
95 of the sheep watching tv do n't want to rack their brains,0
as hank deerfield a proud and meticulously organized retired army veteran and patriot his presence fills screen after screen with emotional persuasion to lead the audience through an astonishingly thoughtprovoking journey,0
this movie made me chuckle several times but they were mainly out of shock that the directorwriter actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together,0
there are some striking scenes the dance sequence when press and julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red and the end is very striking,0
and the cinema 's peeling paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess onscreen,0
we know the events we do n't need to dwell on them again,0
people die things explode and an hour and a half of your life is wasted as you watch this deplorable film,0
i admit that i enjoy those fancy sounding concert dvd 's i love music and the sound is a very important aspect but it 's refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest,0
even the wedding pictures and the review board room factually correct,0
one of the greatest crimes made against scifi television was the cancellation of farscape,0
the very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together,0
want a great recipe for failure,0
at this very point we should wonder if this 'evil' woman is not actually just career oriented,0
team it up with chopper and dirty deeds for your aussie crime fest or lock stock and two smoking barrels and miller 's crossing for an international falling short of the criminal gangs fest,0
make vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film,0
the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone 's time and money making a movie that obviously does n't even deserve to be on film,0
the film follows a young female drifter who gets into trouble whilst in canada,0
the plot is n't really the important part,0
a complete waste of money,0
the idea behind this movie was great,0
instead of having the title boys and girls it should have been he 's all that,0
did anyone see this movie,0
there are only two positives in this movie maggie q is hot and thomas lennon 's performance other than that it 's basically worse than gigli,0
it is here that the main point of contention with standard operating procedure arises,0
it was like watching joel schumacher direct ricky martin as hannibal lecter,0
in a story where toys come to life and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected,0
in accordance with the campy aura the film 's main focus are a group of teenagers who hang out together and whose camaraderie is indicative of such films and could still be an inspiration,0
however the impression i have is that like it happens with wine this sitcom has been getting better and better throughout the years,0
the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city but it is unable to do it,0
if you feel you have the answer then everyone else must be wrong,0
let me put it this way,0
although i did like it better than the previous films that i 've seen from directorwriter michael hurst eye candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination my grade c,0
i bought this expecting a modestly done br clone,0
the mood does donna is an upbeat song which emphasizes the happy mood whereas flesh failures has a driving intense beat in a minor key,0
fantastic movie truly heartbreaking but very well made,0
i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws,0
but after saying that it is an excellent movie,0
i urge everyone to see this film,0
disney really should stop these directtovideo productions,0
seems as though his look changes with each character he plays,0
i felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the scenes flashing by,0
parts of it are slow but there is action in it,0
whatever the case it 's an incredibly unique and very haunting film,0
something that is n't really the case for space truckers most of the gags lead nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses,0
before the movie starts there is an advertisement for some film institute by mr ghai,0
i 'd have to say this is the most boring part of the movie and yes i realize i just said it 's the entire plot,0
it is a romance a war story an actionadventure and historical fiction all nicely woven into one,0
the trains the old house the fallen runner the really scary landslide the drama if the children can stop the train or will it crash,0
after about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin,0
hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over,0
gerard reve is also the fictional name of the main character,0
we know that he is going to be making political statements in the film and some of them are clear while others are not unless spike has completely lost all sense of balance,0
the photography is gorgeous but does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of the dvd purchase,0
the problem with the killer elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director sam peckinpah,0
in the final scenes the desperately sad and tragic events wind up in a curious ending neither happy nor sad but about as heartening a cinematic experience as i have had this year,0
overall i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo,0
it was a mistake not to include the themes,0
unfortunately it does n't quite work as part of the story because it 's very hard to figure out just what petiot is doing for the collaborators or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night,0
i cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater,0
i could go on awhile but save your time and do n't waste it on cb4,0
it 's awful and i found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom,0
for that matter neither was solomon,0
this has to be the worst football movie ever made,0
the background music of the film also plays a very good role it is just too good,0
by the looks of it burton did n't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong,0
both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour coming to rolling stops at each stop sign and red light very dull stuff compared to this movie,0
you can watch it again and again all day long,0
such a powerful story about the disappearance of three civil rights workers down in rural mississippi,0
i had heard a lot about this episode before i actually got to watch it but it lived up to and blasted past all my expectations,0
no doubt we 'll see more of her,0
really though its just too soppy for me,0
bachelor party 2 the last temptation has a couple laughs here and there but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished,0
they did manage to oneup the abortion scene by having the freshly removed fetus getting stomped on by the ladies who cut it out,0
if this was an attempt at humour it failed just like the rest of this movie,0
certainly did n't see it coming,0
without checking her credit card,0
it 's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to charles boyer,0
we are in a small town a homely widow hires a handyman to look after her house,0
at the time i decided to watch this movie i was just bored and read lists of asian films which maybe good,0
tentative hiding behind mannerisms clearly not directed by brooks he is the person in the film who does n't know how to speak english,0
the beautiful cinematography reinforces this repulsively clean and pristine alternative universe,0
veteran filmmaker norman jewison has a proved track record for allowing actors to inhabit characters realistically in difficult situations,0
there is no indication of what one is supposed to feel at any given moment,0
it is played throughout the film and for the end credits please can anyone help either the artist andor title of song thanks mike this is for all you movie buffs lets see if you know your stuff hi i have been looking 4 the soundtrack or a song from the film does anyone know who sung the title song,0
they need immediate medical attention if they do,0
i hate that it presents itself as a voice for latin america,0
and poor bianca comes off like a villain when she 's a victim,0
and naish is always fun to hate,0
why would you do this to such an important and well represented franchise,0
do n't see this movie,0
this cute romantic comedy is a must see,0
the chemist and the dj were pretty fun characters,0
donna is one hot girl,0
the highly underrated character actor marshall bell gave his absolute best as always,0
but they come across effectively without crossing the line,0
what i think he wanted to portray here were those attitudes when you feel bad that you can always put on your make up and face the day looking great,0
so they kind of rambled to someplace they had heard about,0
personally i would have taken mcbain she has it all over annette,0
for those who know i must say one thing,0
what you get to see of the beast is not all that bad and like a lot of cheesy horror fare the finale is the best sequence of the movie,0
all of the key actors oldman penn harris and wright feel as if they were made to play each individual role,0
it 's definitely worth watching just to goof on with friends,0
the camera moves during effects shots real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse i could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds limited technology,0
why ca n't martin scorsese do a police documentary,0
was n't that the book we caught jessica james reading in the closet,0
but the worst thing for me was the adr,0
special kudos to eric roberts as the long faithful friend,0
the attackers were lives were shown as well as matthew 's but all of the attackers dialogue was forced and poorly written,0
and is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping,0
this brought back memories of the good old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers,0
yeah it 's like that,0
i wo n't say more because it is better for you have to enter the story as it unfolds,0
christopher lambert plays a military officer in the near future where it is allowed to have only one child per couple,0
never have i wanted my money back more,0
the only thing that made me not stab myself in the eye with a dirty soup spoon was this line evil doctor guy that 's it you are not james bond and i am not blofeld,0
the problem with this is that it 's virtually impossible to avoid the color red on a daily basis meaning young ricky would have heart attacks every time he got a test back graded with red marker,0
i have recently seen a few episodes there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays,0
jos sancho gives a good support as sancho reaching the extremes with his face,0
i 'll watch anything with depp or ian richardson which is how i got skinned on this ppv rental,0
the time it takes to watch this movie would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow,0
obviously whoever made this movie has some friends in high places because i have no idea who would think making this movie was a good idea,0
this came on tv on time and i got my daughters to watch it they were teens and they loved it to,0
one of the core reasons for the film 's success is the central performance from laura cannon,0
i truly felt for o at this point in the film,0
all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones,0
still with a plot that would make arnie blush and more stereotypical characters than can be seen outside an episode of buffy the film plodded on,0
it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would accuse it of having anything but the best of intentions and the capability of doing anything but good,0
kate hudson is very pretty and matthew mcconaughey is quite handsome,0
it 's not scary there 's no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it 's so obvious,0
the plot of this film is ridiculous too,0
viewing this film makes you question no pun intended yourself on whether or not you want to continue watching it,0
it 's not everyday that you get to meet and converse with a porn star but that opportunity recently presented itself,0
he was a quiet man is not a perfect film,0
then there was the yen lo an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win,0
i hate to admit it but i actually cried at one point,0
it 's an incredibly boring film with silly moment,0
we all know about the evil nazis and the atrocities that happened during that horrible time but none of us were there,0
sure it is a new take on vampires,0
many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made but i think it was about right,0
this movie moonstruck is totally happy go lucky,0
i thought choke had potential but i thought it could have been a much better film,0
costumes are exquisite even the shabby ones,0
the dream censor is ridiculous to say the least if they can eliminate wet dreams then why are prisoners going around raping their fellow inmates,0
i started reading reviews last week so i was aware that all the really good stuff in the book was n't going to be in the movie,0
the nature of totalitarian ideologically driven regimes makes them good settings for drama and the presentation of the best and worst of human nature,0
i watched it thinking it was going to be a jim belushi vehicle but belushi was n't the star,0
some people may not be comfortable with the magical element,0
despite this being an early role for future superstar pitt he is too old to be playing a high school teenager,0
lets ask mikey to do it he 'll try anything,0
perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role and the men actors had more emotion then the film could have had a chance,0
a really awful movie about a 30 meters long shark,0
it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler,0
until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up,0
not to mention how boring the renovation part is,0
second is the amusing assured performance of william powell,0
this very well may be academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released,0
all i saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say,0
the climax with him and eastwood is unforgettable,0
as it was i was left hungry,0
waiting in the cold on rosenstrasse lena fischer is at first reluctant to take in ruth responding in a way that we take as typically german,0
that night at a party he see 's rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but does n't tell anyone of his true feelings,0
it makes you feel connected not only to the main characters but to all the characters,0
a good example of this is in the scene with his new boss who offers him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash saying here 's a little something to get you started,0
like so many other reviewers on here my memories of this show are universally warm,0
everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves,0
the melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off,0
i 've said enough here,0
so please do n't be discouraged if you 're a yuzna fan and you 've read any of the negative comments about this movie,0
it 's as though he 's trying to be a poor man 's clifton webb,0
that nearly all the characters are kids,0
and the love scenes are ruined by sloppy obvious cutaways to a body double for roth who does not even have the same shape,0
if this played in any theater it should be closed down,0
and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners,0
shaky camera bad acting and a lot more things i 'd rather not get into made this the worst experience in my life,0
and now often do you get to see jean harlow give another woman a swift punch in the jaw,0
at first glance it was a little bit disappointment when i saw melissa p i had an expectation that melissa p herself would have played in this movie,0
but if you ever liked any adventure game play this,0
i do n't know whether the movie might be a hit or a flop but one thing 's for sure it will definitely be remembered as one of the finest films ever made in bollywood,0
i am so glad that i did,0
the actors portraying the beatles a relatively similar in looks,0
the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction is this the film the critics are raving about,0
the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks,0
yet from a somewhat a different perspective the remaining episodes might be the most intriguing,0
comments if you have seen under siege with steven seagal you have seen this one,0
quinn basically plays a racist police named capt,0
so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings,0
unlike its live action movie counter part this is a well made movie with intelligent characters,0
still it is lots of fun and i was torn between giving it a 7 or an 8,0
the 80 's were really the decade to live in,0
there is zero personality attached to these characters,0
the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script,0
nevertheless it is beyond me why this film landed on britain 's infamous video nasty list as nobody could possibly see anything but ridiculousness in this sorry attempt of a film,0
the plot was unrealistic and just a boring depressing movie,0
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games' a character study fraught with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game,0
the film has got one turning point,0
the hero is in the worst situation,0
a movie being on mst3k does n't necessarily qualify it for being a terrible movie,0
the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids leading another group to go after them,0
this is certainly among her better films,0
get caught up in that story then suddenly you 're back to the first addict or are you,0
about the only good thing in the whole thing is at the end when the credits roll,0
murder in the blue room was a personal favorite of it 's star anne gwynne,0
this is not some genre any fool can play around with,0
the story itself is one of remarkable courage by a defiant nation who refused to buckle under to the devastating attacks inflicted upon it by up until that point an invincible war machine,0
and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films could take away the dry taste in my mouth,0
on the dvd from dark sky films there is a funny bonus interview with director bruce kessler,0
i feel bad for walken,0
this movie is n't even worth renting as a laugh,0
it seemed that the screenwriter had some wonderful ideas for argument scenes and exchanges of dialogue and just filled in the rest of the story,0
there was n't anybody on the show i did n't like and felt the acting was superb,0
so i approached watching this the way i 'd approach doing homework,0
this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them,0
so convincing and inspired is this performance that it is universal in its appeal,0
i loved it whenever he 's talking to her dad and he says are you telling me i 've only known this girl two days and already i care more about her than you do,0
it 's the only thing that 'll make you smile in this sad sad film,0
this dvd is also worthy of owning,0
all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most,0
i started watching this series with keen anticipation,0
if there had been supporting academy awards for acting in 1932 she would have won for this film handsdown,0
thats as close to a spoiler as i can get,0
i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is,0
shot after shot of bishop walking up to some random chick and grabbing her most intimate parts as if he were shaking her hand,0
when it ended i just thought that this was a classic masterpiece,0
in all a movie that 's just ordinary merely because of the cast and the very low expectations,0
a brilliant sherlock holmes adventure starring the brilliant basil rathbone and nigel bruce,0
it has many high points,0
a group of irritating young american dudes and babes explore a cavern in india,0
however this film seems to be distracted by character study and very little attention payed to the plot,0
completely unoriginal ineptly acted and directed and incredibly unfunny,0
maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the makeup artist needs to get another job,0
i hate art in any kind of shape or form,0
dennis the menace in my opinion is an excellent film adaptation of a classic tv show with smashing performances,0
it is as many people say if you go into it with the right mindset a movie such as this can actually be entertaining,0
i realized the punks embraced dissent in the form of doing nothing and embracing it,0
unfortunately it is listed as lost now,0
in doing so hyeon has created a monster,0
i was n't able to do that after tashan because the songs unfortunately just were n't catchy at all,0
the lead girl did n't travel anywhere throughout the film she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the start and she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the finish,0
only add to the mock value that gymkata more then obtains,0
some of this was the result of my seeing the american dubbed version with its irrelevant prologue and bad dubbing,0
for everyone else the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else,0
this is more merde than mere,0
thats not really a criticism just an observation,0
an increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people 's heads exploding brings a young professor 's apprentice stefan to investigate,0
except to say it 's not any more believable than the acting,0
the heroes of the movie are coach jones a man of strength and integrity and radio a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world,0
and so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale,0
they certainly are n't romanticized a la apocalypse now,0
yes the cheese factor in this movie is off the charts,0
in the process he breaks his relationship with his girlfriend turns his back on his only friend and the mute who gave him his poetry,0
david just wanted to con some money and get out of town as he always did with no incentive to kill his lover at this stage,0
poor death stages to boot too,0
's intentions may be evil and decides to break clemens out,0
the movie actually shows how the people both hindus and muslims have suffered from this partition,0
this is the greatest show ever made next to south park,0
michelle rodriguez is perfect in this role and she really impressed me,0
michael davis spoke before the preview and said he was an action movie buff since the beginning and made the movie he wanted to make,0
now i 'll patiently wait for christopher nolan 's inception due out later this year whose trailer is already such a tease,0
one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made,0
this awful film fell into the hands of my friend recently and i was unfortunate enough to be there that night as he watched it,0
i 've never understood how movies which main content involves seeing people stripped of their dignity serves as entertainment,0
the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of huppert 's face and these are a pleasure to see,0
the viewer can only fear the worst,0
but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well,0
laura dern also has a good role as rocky 's friend,0
save your money and view it for free on tv if you think it needs to be seen,0
if you want the complex storyline of ninja scroll just stay away,0
we could n't tell if this movie was designed for little kids or kids and undemanding adults,0
a yakuza mob leader beat takeshi is told by his clan 's head boss to go to okinawa to straighten out a war between two factions,0
in comparison the man falls embarrassingly short,0
i know it 's ridicules and some people call me crazy but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls,0
instead thanks to this laughable costume they come off at times as almost funny,0
the ending was totally contrived,0
you might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical,0
i did n't see the blonde girl on the cover in the movie either,0
older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably have n't heard of him,0
some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing,0
it 's really the americans behind the inhumane targeting of german civilians,0
though the movie is a bit short burn after reading is a very enjoyable film that you wo n't soon forget,0
i was more than a little shocked when i saw the high ratings on this movie,0
the film has the perfect combination of giddy happiness and stabs of sadness,0
you ca n't get much better than this movie with all stunts and no digital generation,0
nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they 've been glued in place,0
you know i always fancy disturbing or strange movies especially when they get shown at the fantasy film festival in hamburg germany,0
if you want a great baseball film suitable for the family check out the rookie with dennis quaid,0
it 's a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches,0
but allen also has too much warmth going on in humor as well as his affection for the upfront plastic appeal of 30s movie characters and atmosphere to make things sour for too long,0
this is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever,0
the direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced like sympathy for mr vengeance there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing,0
i do n't know why the razzie awards attacked the film so much it 's a truly classical love story with great performance music and directing,0
directed by william wellman with a script by ben hecht nothing sacred is more topical today than it was then,0
knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble even when there was no direct criticism in the film producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally,0
i say he was being too nice,0
because we have seen him as human in the first half seeing him as a monster in the second is n't as scary as one might expect,0
a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red,0
at least that 's what happens,0
but why dear reader why did they explain the misadventures of having harvey as a family member instead of showing them to us,0
before he can do that he must clear himself of the murders he is accused of committing,0
recommended for fans of the series and a reasonable entry point classy stuff though not a true great,0
two things i had an issue with and i emphasize here that these things are problems i had and may not be something that would concern you,0
after some persuasion heifetz agreed on the condition that his acting be kept to a minimum,0
why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women,0
the costumes vary some are copies of historical portraits and others are from some costume designer 's fevered imagination,0
he showed no expression or emotions most of the time and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy,0
the plot was cheese and full of holes,0
it is very well done and very interesting,0
the plot was n't that hot when it was there but the characters were interesting and very wellacted,0
and what was with that freaking wig from hell on his head,0
humour was involved but nothing surprised or spooked me,0
the adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble,0
this is definitely worth tracking down on the kino dvd if you can find it,0
i 've seen a lot worse but a lot better too,0
the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on,0
environment does mean something you know i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in '78,0
even if the real world is a terrible series at least it 's more entertaining than this trash of slutty girls and their parties,0
otherwise she plays her poorly because i pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her no matter how much she suffered,0
she is not interesting in the role of victim but comes across as bland boring,0
and do n't expect another villain from the comics or the cartoon,0
unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality,0
this was better than an empty dessert,0
the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with,0
or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies,0
i mean they complain until the cows come home,0
it 's format is based on a documentary style and very badly done i dare to say also its premise is so predictable that it almost becomes painful to watch,0
for the rest of us well watch something else,0
so lois clark the new adventures of superman receives another full 7 points,0
even more so when one compares them to the porter originals left in,0
at the end the film seems to be trying to make some political statement but it just comes across as confused and obscene,0
into this dysfunction comes alice a struggling single parent who has a sad sweetness that harbour cannot resist,0
some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before,0
one feature i found fascinating is that most of the characters are played by real marines not actors,0
it also has its fair share of cat fights and we even get to see ms currie wipe the floor with the almighty william smith who plays a karate instructor,0
the acting is adequate and there are a few brief moments of violence but many viewers wanting a fullfledged creature feature with gory attacks will be disappointed perhaps even bored,0
it amazes me that people continually begin to make apologizes and put indie films on a pedestal just for being indie,0
what follows is tired scenes and nothing special in the whole movie,0
the girl 's reactions just seem dumb,0
but here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same ape culture is on earth,0
i admit will smith can act better than a lot of these rapper turned actors,0
the show delved into the lives of the two main characters and thats what made it interesting,0
i highly recommend this flick you will laugh you will cry and you will definitely drool,0
the story is a group of teenagers are heading to a concert,0
however the standout is rosario dawson whose performance here is an absolute revelation,0
is that saying something about the budget or did cohen just liked it and wanted to reuse it again,0
well that onset experience must have been a good one for them to agree to a second outing,0
anna does n't answer she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word,0
there are plenty of walks in the woods and poetry is quoted and some very deep thoughts about life,0
this movie came out when he was 5 and i saw it for the first time in years and i wish i never did,0
awesome show for the time,0
this for me was a good one a really good one,0
the first part of adama 's statement is fair enough,0
another very disturbing aspect of this very well syndicated is the atmospheric tone and the style in which this movie was shot,0
i do n't think any harm was done if there is something fishy here but i just felt it was worth pointing out,0
dallaire has returned to africa to testify in the war crimes trials but until the 10th anniversary he had not gone back to rwanda,0
on the dvd extras the actors even seem proud that mathematics is not discussed,0
tank 's involvement in the first film was minimal at best but he played the role extremely well,0
if you do n't mind the slower pacing of the older films and black white does not throw you off this film is recommended viewing,0
i literally had to wipe sweat from my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter,0
maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot,0
such is the basis for last winter,0
if you want hot and exciting softcore done properly this is the movie to watch,0
this movie is often compared to mary poppins with a reason,0
that 's probably thanks to the director more than himself,0
once the lights came on in the theatre i could n't get to the exit quickly enough,0
it does have the nightmare on elm st thing going on though with trying to stay awake or having someone watch you so they can wake you up if the dream gets too bad,0
finally the second sequel it totally disappointed me,0
i am a pretty big martial arts fan,0
bruce campbell returns to the b horror movie genre that gave him his cult status this time not only in front of the screen but behind the lens,0
not to mention that it has one of the most horrible endings in the history of horror,0
it was customary for painters from the florentine school to make young men appear more feminine than older men to infuse a bit of innocence in their appearance,0
i assume this side story of love was added to try and get some emotion from the audience so that the ending of the film could pull some tears out,0
the kid gets kidnapped to keep his parents quiet,0
the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero he was intended to establish himself in the underwater technologically advanced city devised by cotten,0
the girl runs into the forest with the son and asks him what was that thing,0
i ate at that nathan 's and walked on that boardwalk,0
i just do not enjoy his performance,0
yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man,0
anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later,0
the movie was very boring,0
the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place,0
the story 4 young korean guys rob a local gas station for fun,0
it 's a masterpiece of cinematography and music yes and also of editing direction writing and acting,0
plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end,0
thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what i think,0
in response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review i ask that you view the film again,0
he too would leave warner brothers in two years for greener pastures,0
the story itself was incredible but came alive by spielberg 's expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery,0
i could go on and on about this movie but i do n't see the need,0
there is also a neat flashback sequence with footage shot for the first film but not seen before,0
you know it but claire denis does n't encourage you to judge him,0
this is both a quality and a drawback of the script,0
both versions sell very cheaply on ebay,0
if such a book actually existed the sexual act from which this film takes its title would no doubt feature in it perhaps to the extent of having a whole chapter dedicated to it,0
and above all the characters develop at a much slower pace than you would expect in a drama about the coming of age still there is some movement in the characters to closely watch the villain omar whose part and acting i liked very much,0
the writer of this movie probably wrote this movie on a typewriter,0
the original ending had stanwyck boarding a ship for europe abandoning brent to his fate but realizing she ca n't do it to him returning to their apartment house and finding he 's shot himself,0
on seinfeld jerry and elaine were not often funny,0
thats not true at all duh,0
this is another series of the time almost all about a group of white people in africa,0
the cover art on the box makes it out to be a horror film and if you go to rent it it will be found in the horror section,0
the atmosphere was heavy i loved the whole feeling of the secluded upstate new york smalltown and the large house david and emily move into,0
in a society where films like guess who and miss congeniality rule the box office i find this to be a really difficult film to universally recommend but there are definitely those out there who will appreciate this film,0
this one though often maligned by the experts is truly delightful,0
these people are my 'family',0
so obviously in this adventure he is n't alone,0
utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features,0
the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks,0
there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it,0
a young male and female are actually the leaders of the cult and commit the violence towards those they want as ghostly minions to serve them,0
before seeing this film i suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator,0
there are about three scenes in the whole movie where something is actually happening each of them last about three minutes,0
the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since,0
it 's because of movies like this,0
this is present on a 4 movie dvd of bigfoot movies and this is the worst,0
the dialogue is still full of problems but the plot is rather good,0
but watch the japanese one first,0
this seems to me to be unjustly neglected among lewton 's oeuvre likewise boris karloff 's performance here is one of his most underrated,0
to do a days of our lives spoof as seen in friends would have been the wrong move for this movie,0
as for the other aspects of the movie others here have covered them in a lot more detail than i but forget about the mystery here this is the ultimate mcguffin,0
one wonders why the critics loathed her virtually driving her out of movies a few years later,0
if one expects a great and gripping movie welcome will be a disappointment,0
once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to confederate forces at the first opportunity,0
apparently this guy is really just a son of a bitch,0
the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman eh you what other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting,0
walken is portraying somebody who went though what must 've been the most traumatic experience that a person could have,0
it can do without comment fake scenes or leading questions everyone including chavez equally gets to make fools of themselves in their own words,0
this had to be the worst wesley snipes flick of all time,0
the acting was bad except michael madsen 's parts,0
the severed head of richard nixon,0
he clearly demonstrates that he is a man who take over any scene and dominate it and the film,0
what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good,0
it is more exciting and has a better plot,0
oh well whatever i do n't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off,0
if anyone in this movie acted like a real person all this would be resolved in around two minutes or so and everyone could go back to their lives but they have to keep the misunderstandings going,0
the director i michael toth telling us at the festival that he dreamed the story including the prayer and the life is a dream in the production title are both consistent with my understanding of the film,0
but the brotherinlaw and the disabled prosecutor struck me as good but seriously flawed individuals,0
when it was all over we all sat around and wondered how such talented group of people and big budget could produce such a laughably bad production,0
when the best role in your film is a bit part that 's barely on screen for 5 minutes that 's another sign you 've written a bad screenplay,0
ted and bruce got their start on just such a movie but they did n't seem to learn from sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie,0
looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids in odd stasis coffins,0
it had a corny 20 's adventure feel to it,0
they do n't make films like this anymore,0
and here i find it just as funny,0
do n't know if mcmurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible,0
and what does this movie tell us,0
not necessarily a household name for today 's generation mcgovern represented the idealism of american politics and it 's fair to say we have n't seen anyone like him since,0
from the viewer 's side there a couple of good director details some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice,0
this is a must see movie for all parents no for all families because it has such a precious and loving message to share with the audience,0
they have sex and do drugs and get drunk and skip school,0
everything from the plot the music and the effects was copied and warped in a way,0
in the final destination films all the deaths were made to look like freak accidents yet you always knew that they were n't just accidents but that something supernatural was at work,0
no plot bad acting unfunny scenes and very very stupid dialogue,0
this was my first woody allen movie and i thought he was funny for the most part,0
i guess there were n't any privates around,0
this one lacks everything the first one has,0
i found the sets and locations to be colorful but that does n't replace a good story the only good thing i found in this movie is i saw it free,0
some people have had a strong reaction to it but mostly and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality filmmaking,0
i doubt many of us here have the privilege to be bored in the most expensive hotel in japan,0
she goes to bat for him all the way,0
the american audience seems to regard the film as leftist ideological banter but they fail to understand the underlying purpose behind the film,0
the animation is quite good,0

1 the this is brought to you by at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part but seeing it 2 more times before it was over was very ordinary,0
this a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people,0
i'm sure they could have taken this film to greater heights but let 's give it its due,0
despite the title the sword bearer and the dvd cover this is not a super hero film,0
instead it 's the male warden and his guards doing all the dirty work,0
the performances from the actors are of a high standard all round although jason donovan in particular for me stands out and of course tim curry who 's eloquent drug land boss is convincing,0
i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery,0
these are some of the many examples of things that go wrong in this movie,0
the career of wesley snipes is downhill,0
its so bad that if you are even the least bit drunk or high you 'll find this movie hilarious,0
regardless of where it ends up if you get a chance to see it you wo n't be disappointed,0
i guess you either love it or hate it but if nothing else it is definitely worth a rental,0
also the casting of a young richard long and a very young natalie wood was a stroke of genius,0
i would not recommend this pile of pooh to anyone,0
the harder the film tries the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud,0
i gave it a 2 out of ten,0
it must have been great in the cinema,0
the ups and down of a family,0
1 it establishes that there is a demon war coming and that the psychic kids will play a part in it,0
the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying,0
this movie fails on so many levels,0
it 's pretty sad too when the usual dimwitted dr watson has to rescue his boss from certain death a couple of times,0
the movie starts off with three nerds who decides to sneak into nowhere for some reason and then a space craft hits the ground and they see a mutated crew member who was impregnated with a spider which was mutated by yes you guessed it,0

the main hero seemed like he actually knew martial arts,0
if you take movies seriously this is not for you,0
in the interview che mentions that the ingredient to revolutionary is love though fidel 's strategy requires groups to be separated into different assignments we do n't know if the others follows che 's code of honor but the focus on che 's people shows a more positive light,0

he does it in an outstanding manner,0
i read about this movie in a magazine in my country argentina,0
i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well,0
the long dream sequence that makes up the middle of the film was totally bizarre more like a vaguely menacing stag film than a dream sequence,0
watch as he strikes the match,0
if this is a 6 gone with the wind is a 4 a moral conflict that all should be able to identify with,0
he has written a bunch of good and well written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul happy,0
i did n't plan to write a comment but there are only five and all their ratings are high,0
jon lovitz was at his annoying worst and the rest of the cast was completely unfunny,0
is this really the same man who urged the virtues of conversation on behalf of a phone company,0
all in all problems are piling up,0
its manga series was first published in 1952 and its television program first broadcast in japan in 1963 basically the storyline of astro boy is a sort of futuristic version of pinocchio but is extended by story lines of action adventure and pure scifi,0
you see a lot of comic slapstick especially from bridgette who kicks major butt,0
by five minutes in you 'll be cheering them on,0
il liked the soundtrack a lot and the use of any rage against the machine with leonard cohen in the same movie is something to be respected,0
then there 's michael clarke duncan,0
it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world,0
i suspected a movie about a soldier trying to find his courage in the civil war filmed during the fifties was not going to be very good,0
maybe they would learn something,0
you will be glad you did,0
the narration by star keach is really bad,0
but somehow they take these wildly different plots from all over the place and turn it into an almost cohesive film,0
the point of being in paris is that you do n't need makebelieve crap to make your days extraordinary,0
first thing that bothered me was a little too much indiana jones wannabe movie but it also looked like casper van dien did n't see those jones movies through,0
i guess that 's the biggest appeal of this movie,0
as far as heist movies go this one is pretty weak,0
following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we 're watching,0
to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating,0
the songs are quite good i especially like the song the plant sings to elmo,0
i was originally going to come to the newport beach one but i had n't been able to because the airline ticket prices went up way too high at the last minute for me to go and i was so disappointed i could n't go,0
the players look like they 're having a grand old time mouthing as many clichd lines the writers could put in the script,0
because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother,0
although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt,0
that 's because it sets up the sequel featuring reggie and jack like i said contrived,0
it just meant that beth has now left the building and with her the one snappy person in the film,0
here 's hoping for more carlin specials to come,0
one of those flicks which are so bad they 're actually good,0
no thats just the beginning,0
he ends up beaten in prison and begins to question his faith for not be able to forgive his attacker,0
but really really really bad,0
higurashi is a story of several different arcs,0
at the beginning it was simply a resistance movement,0
if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two,0
davis unfortunately is not that good,0
it has a surreal feel to it,0
i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing witty insightful or even mildly interesting to happen,0
instead it 's an unsatisfying waste of your time,0
oh dear the best bit of this film is the opening sequence loosely tying it in as a sequel to another film which appears to have nothing to do with this one,0
a documentary about a nomadic tribe in tibet going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing,0
ok the very idea is ludicrous,0
but when final fantasy vii hit the playstation i was addicted,0
the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane,0
you can skip this paragraph if you do n't want to know,0
and then i forget the other time i laughed,0
one of the strangest scenes in the movie is when the kid receives a vision from grandpa that he must pee on the green icing covered dinner his family is about to eat to keep them from becoming trolls,0
from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way,0
quaid takes a job working at sea world in orlando and begins to strike up a romance with bess armstrong a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park,0
he likes her as well but for her it 's love at first sight,0
and testimony 's of the torturers are striking of refusal,0
it 's hard to imagine a more formulaic plot and the dialog and characterization could only be this trite on purpose,0
with operatic music blaring in the background he begins to pull out brooke 's teeth,0
the last of the airport sequels,0
most people i tried to get to watch it did n't enjoy it,0
as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true,0
he 'll not only need his friends to help rescue him but the antidote as well,0
one day back in 'nam becomes one day back in high noon the original,0
no i am not the intended viewer for this but i maintain that this is n't likely to appeal to all that many,0
levy is mildly funny but a little of him goes a long way as he has proved in everyone of his movies,0
it 's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a family comedy,0
naschy 's werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl,0
this is a real diamond in the dirt,0
ok that was a silly plot explanation but like i said as long as you 've seen those movies i mentioned or even if you just saw the plot you get the movie,0
promising plot notwithstanding the movie completely lacks charm or humor or atmosphere,0
expect to be feel weird after you have viewed nowhere because you most likely will feel very strange talk about beverly hills 90210 on acid,0
almost at the very beginning of the 1960 film we see the professor drop unconscious to the floor while speaking on the phone,0
and i should n't have judged over them as well before i met them but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it,0
do n't watch this film if you 're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender,0
it 's a huge part of society,0
the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic,0
a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you do not watch it alone,0
although some attack brando 's accent he is at his near best in nuance and characterization,0
whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant because not only are there all these other subplots going on but to somehow make them all tie in together but also to make each character feel human and come alive not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect very impressive,0
the movie is not what you would typically expect,0
how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man,0
this movie is an absolute total disaster,0
marley shelton did great as the female lead,0
but the plot was horrible,0
i 've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and admit it you do too,0
do they pay any attention to critics and change their choices as a result,0
this movie was probably one of the worst movies i 've seen in a very long time,0
cristina marsillach is good as our leading lady,0
this is meant to be a kid 's movie,0
this film was so amateurish i could hardly believe what i was seeing,0
it 's a damn good movie,0
i read a few comments and i see that only proud and patriotic frenchmen seem to like it that 's all i can say boring long sometimes even stupid ps,0
being in a charitable mood and wanting to make it clear that i am not blaming pia for my disappointment i will give an imdb rating of four,0
second the trail of one character leading to another somehow leads back to the first two characters and that again i found to be a forced decision by the screen play writer,0
there are no explicit sexual encounters although there is violence and some bad language,0
i keep trying to think of one that was n't possibly the mother but that 's it,0
however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back even though it was on tv,0
now i actually think for this movie this was necessary the film had so many plottwists emotional revelations new facts surfacing and being discovered one reviewer said it well yes it is a very logical story but without the very essential back story it just does n't feel right,0
you wo n't regret it,0
in the waiting area they find two other people ronnie a sleeping woman named lindsay who is currently having a terrifying nightmare while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters befriends guy named billy waters the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces,0
technically speaking the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect gorgeous to the eyes and senses and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director fincher 's trademark,0
the combatants shift to fight mode by flipping something on their wrists and a loud computerized voice echoes and flashes fight mode,0
the lighting and set are unique giving it a very interesting effect,0
there 's a hey kids let 's put on a show air about this telemovie which can be endearing in spots,0
yes the scenery of the greek islands is spectacular the best part of the movie,0
of course he also has a nasty habit of eating people 's cows and trying to seduce their goats but surely that 's a small price to pay,0
she comes into the film unexpected and tries every way to get away and just when you think she 's gone from the picture she reappears,0
sure he wins he loses he blows it all on sex drugs and more gambling we get it but where is the real play where is what made him the greatest card player of all time,0
its just really really stupid,0
the characters seemed very inconsistent,0
it was unfortunate that murphy was exploited just because his war record was deemed to be a box office draw but he just could n't act,0
and it 's a pretty bad one,0
and special effects are not so special by the way,0
i already know it 's another predictable piece of cinematic junk in the now regrettably classic formula of commenting on the state of modern dating via terrible comedy,0
this movie and any movie will necessarily have loose ends and inconsistencies,0
recognizing that he is getting nowhere he begins a chaste relationship with norah a woman who adores him,0
if anything tigerland provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat,0
i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest lifeaffirming way this stylized secret of kells is a classic,0
exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr x but never mind,0
the acting dialogue is very very real as close to reality as you can get for hollywood acting,0
apparently though no one has any civil rights and one guard named stu is found dead a staged suicide he was murdered by one of the prison staff to protect their jobs,0
they end up at some old creepy lady 's house who hates men and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion,0
having instantaneously achieved his purpose of getting away from a depressing home life among bickering parents gus finds himself purposeless until he drives past a glittering billboard reading motorama and decides to win the lottery that it promises,0
it 's a better research problem than murder because we can all understand why someone might kill someone for personal reasons,0
budget production value or experienced crew do n't have to stop the self described director from realizing their dream these days,0
it gets on it 's knees and starts bobbing like a trained seal,0
they were trying really hard for laughs and it just was n't working,0
also the final scene where the stepmother finally gets her just desserts is reminiscent of the ring,0
this movie stars steve guttenberg,0
let me start by saying i have a huge respect for gillian anderson 's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why i cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script the premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thoughtprovoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed souffl,0
this littleknown treasure is perfect just as it is,0
the stuffy film is amateurishly put together with a clichd narrative that 's shamelessly derivative,0
could this possibly be a serious effort,0
he probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script,0
had chaplin lived in our times who knows he just might as well have become an aficionado of cgi tools,0
furthermore i found chris and leonora 's relationship somewhat unconvincing,0
definitely a mustsee for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe,0
it is perhaps the worst film that gordon has ever made,0
the film is terrifyingly bad with awful characters awful acting and an awful end,0
it is fantastic to see a good australian comedy for a change and even if this is not a box office smash it will become one of those australian movies which australians love,0
wish hbo never cancelled it,0
jang initially explores the idea that j is the one that in control of the situation then hauntingly the reversal happens when j becomes obsessed with y it is a very small change and due to the graphic content of this film it can easily be missed but it is there,0
how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon,0
feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other,0
his super commando jokes outdated disco fewer all the crap in the movie made itself boring,0
hopefully even the target audience will realize the recycled uninspired nature of bride wars,0
bottom line if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year it 's all on this dvd with cool special features,0
this and many more scenes add nothing to the film,0
daniels might be the next bruce lee for all i know and probably knows his moves since he 's been a pro but in this movie he 's worst than most c grade hong kong movies,0
the whole thing was disconcerting,0
the little american cecil b demille mary pickford jack holt raymond hatton,0
peter falk is marvelous as an aging actor who wants to decide when he will die so he can continue to know how things will end and not be a member of the audience,0
i had heard it was good but not this good,0
the narration aside herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary 's soundtrack,0
nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new,0
the story moves incredibly slow for an hour and twenty minutes then the freak show owner dies jade reveals herself as the bitch she is and the freaks take their revenge all in the last five minutes,0
i did n't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie,0
just make sure you read them andersen 's story too,0
i wonder who was responsible for this mess,0
not only did they fit their parts perfectly but they made you believe,0
whatever the motivations the story is about a strangely mismatched couple who man a small space station,0
and i can tell you that a more obnoxiously racist experience i 've never had,0
and i do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from thora birch,0
it is definitely one to see,0
they are mentioning other movies jon voight and dustin hoffman have appeared in at a later time,0
a shame because the basic story showed some real promise,0
this production is in short a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure,0
i give it one point for a strong female one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster 's light blue eyes of which there are plenty of shots of,0
i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is genx,0
instead dracula ca n't suppress his appetite and the doctor is eventually infected by a blood transfusion with vampirism,0
he definitely had an ugly mug,0
we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it 's much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the us over christmas,0
there are some surprisingly dark moments particularly the opening scene and the nighttime exterior shots are simply magical,0
it does n't matter what every other user comment says about this movie do n't waste your money watching it,0
its tvmovie feel is strong but could be forgiven if it achieved its goals in the other departments,0
anyway he is served by his wonderful british butler sir john gielgud om who won an academy award for his performance in the film as best supporting actor,0
fortunately the film is not a waste of time for the fans of this genre,0
who gives a damn huh,0
today after the death of princess diana we often remark about the insensitive paparazzi,0
i am a bitter romantic,0
tanguy made me laugh even though my understanding of french is far from perfect,0
i genuinely smiled during those and during the last scene with the police officer,0
but wherever it was filmed it looked great,0
all of the soldiers i knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of communism,0
the whole movie has great gags that everyone can enjoy and they 're really funny,0
i chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on imdb,0
there 's nothing innovative here,0
everything about this horrible sequel just blows,0
death bed the bed that eats,0
bullshit author and victim returns home and learns things about him self and makes teacher see the error of his ways sounds like a good serious movie,0
when he tells her goodbye and not goodnight a look of puzzlement and humiliation comes over her face,0
underneath she 's wearing some stylish white pajamas why not show them off,0
she also has to relinquish any sort of personal desires and can never leave the shop,0
this was n't a movie for fat women at all contrary to the commercials that were run for weeks before the premiere of this pathetic lesson in moral fiber for skinny women the world over,0
its easy to get on the mel gibson hate bandwagon,0
yet kersey does n't get mad he gets even as a oneman judge jury and executioner against those who prey on the innocent,0
this time around henry is on his own and looking for work,0
because they do n't have the capacity and you were never taught to look you were only taught to take what is right in front of you,0
the makeup work and the striking motif is all that keeps you watching this misfire,0
the wolf makes sure he gets there before red does,0
christina inherits a rural property that she intends to open a mountain lodge,0
suffice to say that i had n't dropped off but suffered some temporary memory loss induced by this celluloid form of sedative,0
i found it a highly enjoyable look at history,0
jay russell directs this fantasy a whole family can enjoy,0
all in all i believe chicken little is a failure that i define as hot having a good story to match its sweet computer animation,0
they had no idea back then how far it would eventually go,0
3 the acting was terrible,0
at least a couple good scares,0
handsome falls in love with her completely and ca n't reason right from wrong,0
oh right she orders pizza from the internet,0
watching kevin williamson films means torturing,0
mancini recycles it over and over again but through different lenses,0
while i enjoy racy humor where appropriate these skits were needlessly vulgar,0
instead the journalist kidnaps the perpetrator,0
all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire,0
i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine,0
i disliked the scene where slick lectured susan on her inability to forgive her mother,0
credit where it 's due the nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part,0
actually it 's not a bad flick by fangoria films just there are better ones out there which are similar in vein,0
filmed in crisp blackandwhite the program is divided into three distinct parts,0
still thriller is great fun and an absolute must on halloween,0
her lover then reveals to her that their relationship was just an experiment and she really likes men,0
the thing is they 're better actors than this movie would have you believe,0
he also was the good guy while robinson was the bad guy and stanwyck was twice as bad as robinson,0
the acting is poor the dialogue is poor the storyline is disjointed and poor,0
the cast in and of itself are good actors but their characters are underdeveloped lackluster or just plain wrong,0
having seen both films now i 'd have to say that i agree with that assessment,0
stay away from this film,0
not a whole lot to redeem the rest,0
she starred in one of the ones that became nothing,0
this does n't seem to have any purpose at all,0
if you can wrap your head around the era recognize that churning out b movies does n't necessarily mean poor quality as a standard and be thankful that wayne does n't sing in this one rainbow valley,0
i mean was this movie ok or was this movie ok it also teaches a lot about wise youths and i this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants,0
yet for one reason i ca n't,0
the start of this film was a bit funny and set some good premises for the happenings to take place,0
her bill was also really quite moving especially when she acknowledges that her ring finger no longer has a wedding ring on it,0
however the plot is not hard to follow,0
the greatest actor that ever lived is this time not only acting with marilyn monroe but he 's also directing her,0
the film was meant for children but this was waaay to childish at times,0
in my humble opinion tony scott was trying too hard,0
and balding leif garrett can hardly keep his eyes open the whole time anyway,0
ripoffs of better movies check,0
actually it 's one of the best movies i 've ever seen,0
i also love comedies including offthewall comedies like married with children and family guy but this show just does n't' do it for me,0
the story is alright but the animation is not very good,0
it also helped courtney cox 's career a lot you must see this if you do n't have a stick stuck somewhere hehe and if you like to laugh 8 out of 10,0
let 's make him an admirable character,0
the killings are sporadic and dull failing to generate any kind of suspense or momentum,0
great cinematography by future director jan de bont,0
robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gunslinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western,0
the editing in fact ruined the film for me as the black outs came at the climax,0
with a bigger story and more characters and a better playground for kevin home alone 2 manages to be a superior sequel,0
since they themselves are surely dimwitted for writing this crapfest they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window,0
and but first ted i 'll shoot you you little b both directed at a teddy bear make this a very funny and enjoyable movie,0
and who are the ritz brothers,0
not much attention was put into seeing how the characters fit into their perspective roles,0
however scene by scene the movie is so obsessed by its quest for genuineness that it becomes comical at first then outright hard to watch toward the end,0
i'm really amazed that this got an 88 on rotten tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the oscars,0
he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving,0
for people who think this is the new all in the family or married with children have you ever actually watched those shows,0
everything in the film is far too tongue in cheek but when you have people getting killed and a serious tone it does n't work,0
matt leblanc stars as a guy who has a great pitching arm,0
i guess a couple of notsogood performances also contributed to its mediocrity,0
i have read it countless times and have enjoyed it every single time,0
he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british,0
cher 's acting skills really come out in the film because dolly seems to be the complete opposite to cher 's character,0
strange that this was belushi 's second film of 1990 dealing with him getting an alternative lifestyle of riches which was found in taking care of business,0
shaun cassidy this is a masterpiece,0
lots of gyrating naked women and a token view of some men in towels,0
ilias our nominal hero is bland and forgettable,0
i figured that with these two elements in place things could n't possibly be as bad as i 'd heard,0
beyond the few laughs supplied by jerry stiller 's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny,0
but someone came up with a great first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and then promptly did a runner leaving their abandoned 5 yearold daughter to finish it off,0
it may seem odd out of context but with in the context of the film it is very moving,0
back in the 1960 's those of us who were bad movie aficionados thought that plan nine from outer space was the worst movie ever made and would remain so for all time,0
and bellamy is so good at playing dumb you have to wonder if perhaps he 's not really in on the joke,0
for all his worth argento delights in operatic movements as well which well highlights the action,0
it 's plot holes like that that make the movie unbearable to watch at times,0
strangely enough the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she 's behind bars,0
maybe i'm too hardcore halflife fan but the so called halflife 2 is not halflife 2 and i have a question is this the next chapter of halflife,0
these family members are all more advanced than taz and always talk normally,0
considering the greater part of the movie is supposed to be frightening this is a major flaw,0
they only share the title in common,0
except he was in the bourne identity and i liked that,0
with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door myself included,0
surprisingly good for a midday movie and one that i 'd happily watch again,0
someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars,0
pearls before swine does n't stand out on quality of acting plot or any other conventional measure of rating a movie but as the title suggests places itself above the average viewer in its magnificent value of integrity,0
of all the films of shahrukh khan which are available on dvd i would say this is one of the least pleasing i 've seen,0
the plot was simplistic but had potential typical fish out of water scenario with east coast transfer student jordan feeling out of place in a laguna beach high school run by a group of championship surfers led by tyler,0
with the help of a buddy he finds out that a criminal has split town suddenly for mexico and he goes there to locate the man and hopefully clear his own name,0
mattelli should run the investigation,0
for others the film will probably open up a window into the experience and for still others many scenes may provoke disgust and revulsion,0
these are so delicate that i assume not even all modern japanese actresses are eligible for the roles in geisha let alone the two chinese and one malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably did not know japanese culture that much,0
putting the ufo thing aside,0
characters were not explored and aspects of the location and politics were ignored,0
when chuck 's attractive neighbor belinda a hooker is in need of a pimp bill gathers her and her friends and he and chuck run a prostitution service out of the morgue,0
its not often you see a movie go from completely serious war film to sci fi time travel to comedy and then somehow manage to keep its war film story intact that you 're anxious to see how it all ends,0
in the end it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession,0
it might not have dated that well and the premise of the film might be considered ludicrous now but it does n't stop it from being an exciting adventure,0
he puts in a marked performance in that film as well,0
it 's a visual style with life of its own,0
music was a little better than the acting,0
the movie itself was just as bad as any movie you 'd expect to be combining christmas and the three aforementioned celebrities,0
the lingerie and sex toys company that targets female consumers said its adverts aimed to give women sexual confidence and always showed women in control of their sexuality,0
this movie is very much an rrated title but suitable for teenagers under the right circumstances,0
there are laughs interspersed here and there but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning,0
i think that the movie answered that question admirably,0
he is a guide but rightfully not one we are encouraged to easily identify with though at times i certainly can,0
this is a very well made war movie though i 've got to admit that this is a genre that usually does n't do that much for me,0
all in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects,0
i think the entire cast is excellent,0
as already mentioned spielberg did n't receive a best director nomination for his efforts,0
neither is it clear that they have agreed not to announce their engagement or why,0
but grunnick fails in his attempt for a romance with jane craig because she finds out from altman that grunnick sometimes fakes circumstances in order to make people like him,0
it also shows its more violent parts in history,0
so how does loving evangeline rate,0
if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots it would have a much better effect,0
lost in translation is a very wellcrafted film,0
the movie is worth seeing among all the cynicism we get today for its sincere intention to present a modern ethical issue without any desire to arouse the viewer,0
things seem to come full circle in that ty power collapsed on the set while dueling with george sanders as adonijah,0
if you have a chance be sure to see this amazing film,0

the films are somewhat surreal in this respect,0
ving rhames has made a very important movie that needs a much wider audience than it has received thus far,0
however it is the performances the script and the fantastic style of this movie which pulls it out of the mundane and into the cinematic,0
of course i live in smalltown indiana so that 's most of the problem right there,0
the meteor shower was a dead ripoff of the monsoon,0

the plot is not the best but it does not take from the gags which the film is really all about,0

this is not a movie version of the magic flute,0
the way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny,0
i find with most critiques of mainstream big budget films those who fall into two camps those taken in by the hype by the surface of the film and those who feel and understand the film aware of its flaws,0
i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies,0

i honestly think this movie could have been so much better as it is it 's just another hollywood version of exotic japan,0
the movie se7en starring brad pitt morgan freeman and gwyneth paltrow is by far one of the most inventive wellwritten and cerebral films in recent history,0
she is unbelievable looking a worth the price of the ticket alone,0
the scene progression is often nonlinear,0
louis jordan was a bit weak,0
everything about the film stunk of terrible quality,0
but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it 's been made and simply is,0

to those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch jim carrey and jeff daniels play the roles that they were meant to play,0

it was not a ferrari at all,0
this was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that i shall never tire of watching many many times,0
oh yeah manna was n't the only thing sent from heaven do n't forget the birds for meat,0

you will quickly notice his huge gut within 10 minutes into the movie,0
the second one i would like to see all three brothers one sister and their mom and dad to do a movie together,0

here dana is not only clueless to her daughter 's conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition,0
with his extreme closeups and quick cuts boyle ca n't even pull off a 20 second fight in a corridor without losing the audience,0
so the fact that this picture never surfaced on the shelves of walmart as its featured heroes clobbered the box office in the summer of 2005 says a lot,0
clark is there to see whether the billion dollar project should be shut down or not,0
this sequel focus mostly on bambi and the relationship with his father something clearly missing on the original,0
there are so many plot holes that it makes it hard to concentrate on the bad active grade school haunted house makeup special effects or the terrible sound effects,0
i believe that he was a traitor during nazi occupation siding with the puppet french government but he did remake his name before his death,0
the fear is not in death but in not knowing,0
nothing about landing returning to the normal life,0
that would probably be the most popular show on tv and spawn spin offs like who wants to be an executioner,0
aside from the aesthetically pleasing aspects of the movie i actually did n't know who the killer was right up until the end,0
on the positive side i loved the background music,0
the dialogue is wooden and lifeless,0
and most of all it illustrates the immense power of spiritual healing,0
she was so convincing that its tempting to believe it was n't an act although everyone involved with cut says she was lovely to work with,0
heat vision and jack takes humor out of it 's ridiculous premise bad dialogue and melodramatic acting parodying bad television shows mainly knight rider,0

the story of the sniper was significantly changed for the film from the true story which is much more compelling,0

but that 's all this movie is,0
there is n't a dull moment,0
i could watch this film tonight and enjoy it while i 'd rather go to the dentist than watch chicago again,0
special effects are going backwards,0
it 's kind of hard to explain why,0
ricky gervais gives the only interesting performance as the voice of bugsy but he ca n't really save the film,0
the majority of the clips are over five to seven years old if not older,0
i 'd been waiting for this since before they started filming,0
we just know that they are eating people and see just one little scene of the butcher at work which was by the way happening in a dream,0
they have ridiculously overdone battle scene 's and the rest of the film seems like it is on auto drive until they get to the next action scene,0

in that sense my dinner with andre leaves the audience imagining as they would reading this in a novel,0
after watching over 1000 east asian films i 've been able to identify the types of movies that are a waste of time,0
also kurtz was n't even on the steamboat when he died which especially made the entire journey even more futile which just got annoying after a while,0
i'm really surprised this film has been rated so low,0
and i love mindless action flicks,0
if you can watch these two films this one first,0
why is he so weak ill,0
okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they 've made,0
this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it,0
especially noteworthy is a full length commentary track running alongside the faded out action,0
while this is not the worse adaptation it did have its flaws which may keep the jane eyre fans cringing,0
if you were on it you were all that,0
the movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly,0
the only problem i have with this is that some of the heroes are actors or actresses so they have already been on tv they should have gone with the american idol approach and made it average people that you can find on the streets,0
this one stays with ya,0
all in all a funny entertaining film with a great cast,0
at times i felt bored and confused,0
corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad sad sad sequel,0
i watched this movie years ago,0
waiting at the fair lady 's island estate are three small trunks only one of which contains images of the princess,0
got to this show late believe it was the 3rd and final episode when first watched it and was blown away by a social commentary that has n't been seen on american tv since 'all in the family',0
the whole film has the feeling that was a rushed affair,0
i 've seen this film 3 times on the cinema and is probably one of the reasons it became a box office hit,0
a very likeable and exciting movie,0
this film is arguably one of the worst ever made,0
the common denominator here is the awesome house band,0
difficult to understand all the negative reviews for this enjoyable and well acted movie,0
and yeah his beard 's silly,0
but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense full of uncertainties and unknown elements just fall flat in the movie,0
i thought it a wonderful story and a great production too,0
his name is ron silver a gifted actor and a coldblooded killer,0
the strange thing about jill the ripper is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller,0
ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post,0
at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 1957 dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her torrid overthetop portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a texas oil tycoon in written on the wind,0
problems with this film include 1 incredibly fakelooking gorillas,0
scene after scene of extreme closeups where characters do n't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do not make an interesting or relevant story,0
the movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill dooley for the way he treated him in the past,0
i challenge anyone to sit through all off this movie,0
sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk let alone act,0
i only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states,0
having said that it 's rather bland and unemotional at times although in the few scenes in which there is emotion that emotion is well portrayed,0
yet oddly enough although plainly she 's out of her element the fishoutofwater aspects of the story just do n't work,0
did anyone else notice that the dad in this was trying way to hard to look like robert redford,0
now i also realise that some may say cronenberg often favours the more direct approach and tries to test his audience with occasional bouts of realism straight out of a comic book but i'm sorry just because he has built up a reputation of doing things this way does not mean he get away with sheer sloppiness of this magnitude,0
then they are like we are so happy together then he dies oh no then she tries to get his slippery and slimy corpse back into the car for like half an hour,0
nothing in the film exists outside of the possibilities of reality the simple omnipresent score confirms that by imagining in music the connection between heartbeat and dim light,0
daniel auteuil seems to be the only one who realizes he is totally out of place but he ca n't find a way out from the set,0
i had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie,0
jeff daniels does a superb job in making us believe that a movie character can leave the screen,0
the trail of the pink panther was mediocre but it had funny moments the curse of the pink panther is a stretch too far,0
the acting is the kind of stilted overacting you see in a bad high school play,0
that something is called growing up,0
it is more of a comedy than a horror movie,0
anyway the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters,0
some parts of the film are definitely dated like the zombies with afro haircuts,0
i also thought it about time that since selena lopez is finally playing a character with latina roots,0
this movie is a supposedly intellectual enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story,0
hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of stack 's and the stalked love interest of malone 's who moans groans over rock through most of the film,0
ben travis plays the role as a father who is only interested in one son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophy 's however he hates it very much and even his father,0

in her previous film for me and my gal people often say that she looks emaciated,0
mckee knows how to create a mood of foreboding but he chooses to do it through artistry rather than through cheap manipulation,0
at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish,0
why do filmmakers like subhash ghai show indians as good people and ny people as bad people,0

oh yea and i also want to burn lady in plaid 's wardrobe,0
i just ca n't see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it,0
the car chases are very badly shot with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads and they 're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you 're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting,0
suffice it to say it is a typical wagnerian synthesis of diverse elements in this case a blending of the holy grail legend with the principles practices and pageantry of christianity,0
while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad it is a great film for two reasons,0
okay so it 'll take a while for this next part,0
this is even more apparent when she woos a very young and handsome cary grant,0
at last they arrive at the mountain and maybe perhaps he will get around to skiing down the friggin' thing,0
so come on all you others you think it sucks please speak up now guess i 'll have to check out wikipedia to find out what this guy really did,0
its portrayal of the mayan culture including its strange dress hair styles costumes tattoos body piercing and decorative scars as well as its industry class system cities warfare weapons myth and religion provide a bizarre and fascinating anthropological backdrop for what is at its heart a solid thrilling fast paced old fashioned struggle between good guys and bad guys,0
how about this quaid to zhang ziyi well i should also tell you that i'm not very good with children,0
the movie was a lot like predator but it kept you on the edge of your seat and it had an interesting twist at the end,0
i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein and his performance is extraordinary but that 's the sole exception,0
the film is a colossal bore,0
it only has some innovative demonic behavior scenes which fans of such movies like my friend might enjoy,0
i do n't think alan bates has done a better film than this,0
the plot concerns rita fighting to help sam keep custody of his daughter because as the state sees it foster care is better than a mentally retarded father,0
the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow,0
they are deeply disturbed deeply dysfunctional deeply inadequate people not the creepily charming mastermind presented here,0
i'm not sure the diagnosis and terminology is correct in the film but in layman 's term crawford plays a total whack job,0
i'm not a stupid person yet i simply did n't understand what this film was trying to say,0
she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story,0
also if the two last stories had n't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch,0
and what is furthermore brilliantly satirical is that norma 's life is not so bad,0
if he has long hair he smokes dope,0
what is particularly amusing is the presentation of the one world ruler,0
i mean how would you feel if your fianc left you on your wedding day for your cousin,0
this film marked the end of the serious universal monsters era,0
she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc 's airwaves,0
plus the aerial sequences are much better than jet pilot 's,0
we ca n't forget the people who did n't have such big roles in the film but still helped make it great,0
i felt no sense of preaching indeed it was the brevity of expressed points of view that lent it the sense of reality that one lives with every day,0
he seems to want to break out and bound around the stage as he would have in a real show,0
so they did n't happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood,0
the cell is a rather difficult film to classify,0
today the captains of our rotting media institutions are much more sensitive that robes they merely murder your character with innuendo and false charges laid down without foundation or sources,0
she saw the dead body as a kid so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it,0
i know there was little to no budget for this dud but i 've seen better films at student film shows at our local university,0
some reviewers identified elements common to other movies they are right,0
i think it was time her story was heard,0
but like all machines they break down will she give into her emotions or will she go through her missions like a good slave,0
and it never told us what happened to her father,0
rose mcgowan 's lines are not only unfunny but increasingly irritating as the movie goes on,0
they just do n't make many this good,0
the orphanage is a very well made good old fashioned horror,0
which is funny to me because if there 's anything that i 'd think should be changed for the sake of theatricality it 's making a boring person into an interesting person,0
there is only war war horror and staging the horror to make it palatable to those who do not live it have not lived it do not remember it,0
as one of the other students says at the end we 're all so wrapped up in our own problems we do n't notice what 's going on for someone else,0
this documentary must be seen for many reasons,0
john frankenheimer was upset by her failure to report and acted like he was about to fire her but always the gracious lady ms kerr said she was fine just sitting there and would stand in for herself,0
no we 've got to leave,0
plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place,0
most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said,0
oh that 's right fox only cancels the good shows i forgot,0
i also especially liked the actress playing benny 's niece and eddie 's exwife although everyone did a fine job in this exciting movie about playing with bad guys and the doublecrossing that goes with it,0
tony fights three of the don 's goons before getting his privates sliced off with a knife he then gets his penis and testicles shoved down his throat before being tossed in vito 's acid vat,0
i guess that held the thrill of the movie,0
for you trivia buffs out there patrick allen and sarah lawson are married in real life,0
so i think i 'll go out on a limb and actually comment on the show itself,0
they soon comply and execute izo by driving their spears through his body several times,0
i like the part when mr duncan gives kevin mccallister the turtle doves then gives it to a friend to be friends forever,0
it 's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone,0
so pop some corn cuddle up and prepare to laugh your head off,0
from hell but thanks to the creators of this movie he is perfect as the man at the center of the action,0
it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over and they were free from their torment,0
however it is not nearly good enough to be scary,0
when i saw this on cable i presumed it was from the 1960s,0
an ominous pall even a sense of dread hangs over the entire story and there is no hint of how it is to end,0
his antihero in a clockwork orange is tormented by the state in a new process to make him an acceptable citizen and then tormented by one of his old victims,0
it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score and then the rather slow moving opening sequences,0
kelly brook is a pretty face no seriously i think that 's it,0
it is possibly one of the worst movies ever aired in my house,0
since i have seen this tale so often in so many guises i was not overly impressed,0
at first it 's heartening to see the fans give rush a well deserved response,0
the central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a bygone era,0
the cast turned up just to collect a paycheck which is a shame because it is a fine collection of actors,0
but charles the jamaican cop played by tom wright is really pretty good,0
that was not the case here,0
war zones are populated by civilians who could be friends or foes making soldiers easy targets for the kill,0
it is also terribly slow,0
in light of this and that the man had been on the brink of bankruptcy before this leads many to think he must be cheating but how,0
there is only one good song,0
manna from heaven is in need of some divine intervention,0
i would have done it right after this film,0
aside from that the flicks are as demonic as their hero,0
the acting however is not nearly as beastly many of the young aspiring actors admirably showcase a hidden talent,0
saying that i 'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty and she was spending a lot of time with him and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy,0
my sense is that his william wallace would have been closer to the actual character,0
this movie is the proof,0
the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and did n't get bit,0
my heart wo n't go on from this one,0
however i found myself watching many of the bits with unease,0
even americans accused us of inadequate application of force against insurgents,0
this is definitely a film that i need to watch again along with other kim kiduk films in order to truly appreciate it,0
he 's some weird type a comedian not the cool cat he 's supposed to be,0
instead we get mia farrow and jeff daniels in what has to be the most original role of his career as the man who walks off the movie screen and into farrow 's humdrum life,0
and as i said for the sake of all of my friends at school who were in their production of it i will always think fondly of footloose,0
it really should never have got past this stage of development,0
little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together,0
i like nearly all of the actors in this film,0
the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for suspense,0
if people are taking this as fact then there is something wrong with them,0
are there holes in it,0
the filmmakers are simply too intent on plumbing nilsson 's psychological mystique and not attentive enough to his music,0
i 'll stick with the xmen,0
i found mel gibson to be much more believable in the movie what women want with helen hunt,0
i watched it because of all the good comments so i'm warning those with ears to hear,0
very busy and active film from beginning to end,0
i'm a big fan of spinal tap so naturally i had to check this out,0
through the film she contrives a way for the two to get married without the mayor 's approval,0
and it lends credibility to the character as well as the story inasmuch as the plot is fairly insignificant in light of the fact that this movie is really about the characters and the way they interact as opposed to what the storyline is,0
this movie belongs to jimmy stewart though,0
when at home the man breaks into her house and rapes her,0
they add very little if nothing to the story except padding and viewer confusion,0
do n't buy the dvd or vhs it will decrease the value of the dust that it collects,0
but the topper is basil rathbone as an italian violinist with a chico marx accent,0
there is a famous expression called films are slices of life,0
also kudos to his brilliant use of makeup such as the supremely convincing burn marks a gang member suffers in his showdown with an indoor barbecue,0
i read another user 's comments about audio being dubbed but do n't think his was dubbed after all he speaks english right,0
if you feel compelled to watch it avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema,0
despite constant action the story does not progress,0
i wo n't list all the bad things because there 's a lot of them but here 's a few of the most prominent,0
that 's as good as let 's go collegiate gets folks except for two things and one of these depends on how old you are,0
why did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsense,0
i watched this film for two hours and i have no idea who anyone was,0
this movie proves once again that a smart idea means much more than just a millionaire budget,0
as a fantasy it 's just bad,0
it is almost boring despite the fact that the filmmaking in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 i do n't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico,0
one is on the rampage killing people here and there,0
the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian,0
good acting by alison eastwood,0
juan pablo di pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely does n't make a bad turn at his acting debut,0
first of all i 'd like to say my favorite type of movies are cheap horror flicks,0
this is one of those movies that i watch every time it 's on not because i like it but because it 's so bad i ca n't take my eyes off it,0
that this weird triangle works so well can be credited to the involved actors who do a good job,0
in conclusion it takes too long to get to the main storyline and once it gets there it goes nowhere and takes a long time to say absolutely nothing,0
maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly,0
the direction must be faulted as well,0
but in his need for something better can he be sure he is making the right choice,0
it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder,0
well directed and with some brilliantly choreographed action scenes this is definitely one to see,0
finally some of the tributes and references to past european horror movies like cannibal holocaust and burial ground are too obvious shadow dead riot is a movie that could have been a really fun tribute to the exploitation movies of old,0
i wonder if her whole life is n't one big hallucination,0
montana does n't rank in the same league with flynn 's more prestigious westerns like dodge city virginia city and they died with their boots on,0
which is about the art itself,0
there is much unintentional laughter but this is not a fun or funny movie,0
but the role is given to an actress who looks more like she 's in her thirties,0
in spite of the movie 's faults i do subscribe to what one could call the 'message' of the film namely art 's essential role in everyday life art as healing force,0
he encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours,0

the turgid screen adaptation of stephen sondheim 's 1973 masterpiece a little night music is probably in the top five of worst adaptations of broadway musical to the motion picture screen,0
lets start at the beginning flimsy storyline,0

spoiler ahead i mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene,0

i 've seen this movie so many times i 've lost count,0
i do n't know why there 's a prequel for this movie,0
when it was announced he was btk she was shocked,0
both were based on true characters who wrote in the case of lancaster ghost wrote their own memoirs of their time in the joint and the films are based on those books,0
they never struck me as real people,0
truly one of the great ones and definitely my alltime favourite,0
the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over it all makes very little sense,0
suddenly a new person appears and there 's no data on him,0
this was probably a lot of fun for a date movie in the local bijou when it was released in 1950 but it 's hard to imagine anyone watching prehistoric women for anything other than camp or nostalgic value these days,0
this is what an anime fan could get after a month worth of prayers,0
one song in particular is a bit overdone but all in all this is a nice romantic film,0
pick it up cheap like i did and hope for an se in the future,0
this being said the production values here are more appropriate to film and the general casting is excellent,0
a too big mess to make you enjoy this movie,0
it does n't even feel lowbudget this film and watching this film in widescreen feels so good,0
it really is 180 degrees from its suspenseful predecessor,0
the best thing about it is the acting,0
this movie was very good,0
well they do n't and what follows is a gamut of immature genitalia jokes farting jokes masturbation jokes and to top it all off will ferrell 's balls rubbing on a drum set,0
so if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine is n't a very strong believer as i do n't think there 's any evidence for the physics of time travel in the bible,0
and i know nothing about the country that has n't been gleaned from google searches so that should give you a clue about how much he apparently knows,0
they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along,0
on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band,0
on the other hand i am very thankful he made this impressive and thoughtprovoking film and as i am very positive about it i think he did a good job,0
the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity,0
the best part of this movie is when they drag the main character in and beat him with clubs,0
trinity however is a much more personal internal film,0
unfortunately for most of the film they are just shrinking in horror as helpless hostages,0
i 've seen some complain about the camera work and in fact according to the creators themselves the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time,0
the script stays pretty faithful to the original which to be fair i have n't seen in a number of years so the exact details of it are a little hazy it starts out almost sceneforscene although it changes things at the end,0
the reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy so many will feel smart by saying that he 's a genius that his films are masterpieces and all that crap,0
i remember seeing this movie in theatres back in the 80s,0
great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot,0
she was probably most famous for the charming title character in the lady vanishes,0
wonderful animation and adorable characters made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with,0
we were shown this slasher film starring ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow,0
why do we not see them in the later episodes when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value,0
not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people,0
for that matter seek out the work of phoenix artist paul wilson whose scifi short the attack of the 70 foot courtesy lady leaves this film in the dust,0
using tons of stock footage not only from trader horn but also the first two films in the series this is one of the weakest films in the mgm series,0
candy is one of my alltime favorite films,0

it 's always it is i will and that is,0
just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered she 's also totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous,0
the other 10 seem to be thrown in to fill out the time,0

congratulations mr jackson you got me completely fooled,0
when we left the cinema they started to talk about serbian public,0
no sooner is he in when his cellular phone rings,0
originally xrated in 1969 and the winner of the best picture oscar screenwriter waldo salt and schlesinger also won statues,0
more on the corny side actually,0
its relatively simple just turn up at a sales pitch and say your screenplay is a cross between aliens and predator which means the producer will jump at the chance of making a film thats a cross between two massive blockbusters,0

apes was equally good very gory bloody,0
i do n't think i 've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much,0
he did n't know he could do it,0
for now this movie stays a relic of my boyhood past and for good reason,0
by normal they actually mean ordinary and tedious,0
there are cars that blow up when shot pistols that are accurate at 500 yards and huge shotguns that appear from beneath short leather jackets but even with these clichs the action set pieces created by johnny to are exciting fast paced very violent and seamlessly shot and edited,0
being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind determined to love it because i 'd spent money buying it,0
but there are other targets too and they 're all linked to something that happened many years ago and it 's seemingly a series of revenge killings,0
alice faye is very pretty and does a fine job as does ameche who turns in an energetic performance,0
nicholas hammond better known as one of julie andrew 's children on the alltime movie classic the sound of music was spiderman during the dialogue scenes,0
to imitate the first godzilla movie from the 1950s,0
the reaction shots of marie 's seeing an older man swimming in a pool or receiving a recorded message that a body has been found are powerful in their understatement,0
i had seen him in a few movies i 'd already determined that he 's a great actor,0
why ca n't more american films be like this,0
to create a good versus evil battle like never before,0
i 'd give it seven out of ten and would n't treat it as anything serious,0
i was shocked but in a good way,0
however when you go too far and cross the line much of what you do must be put into question,0
it 's about a guy who kills his exgirlfriend 's retarded kid brother and as he is sent to juvenile prison through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you do n't let it go until the very end,0
but do n't let that get you down this film is no way in the shadow of the mentioned films,0
ford was struck by his presence and the rest is history,0
this movie had me wiping tears away in laughter,0

rarely have i ever seen a movie being able to portrait the dream of being in a rock band as good as this,0
i feel ashamed of myself,0
the acting is very good and the characters are very interesting particularly that of the lead boy who manages to play a teenager experiencing difficulties whilst remaining really likable,0
this christian slater vehicle which follows hard on the heels of heathers is along the same lines as his 1989 hit but it is nowhere near as good,0
vic reeves big night out is stupid humour for the very juvenile mind,0
later i would watch the sub but did n't find it as appealing,0
there are certain deaths in this film that you ca n't possibly see coming and even the final battle at the end of the story is shockingly unpredictable,0
however their action setpieces are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without question,0
all this is done in a beatup old car because apparently southerners do n't own anything made in the current millennium,0
frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty hollywood bowl,0
first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i do n't like vampires,0

is all i can say,0
played by juliette binoche the mother is a bosnian refugee working as a tailor in london,0
some sequences really are creepy and the funeral house setting supplies night of the demons with an excellent tone,0
really todd you have a great future as a designer or landscape architect but please no more movies like this,0
johnny 's bound for san margo at his uncle 's request but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha and her conniving brother pedro,0
it is a very long and fun game with innovating stuff for the genre,0
i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang sad,0
this is a movie about ten men all dressed roughly the same in one location and it would be easy for them to be nameless faceless blanks but these were ten characters mostly that was done through the dialogue and the way they reacted to things,0
how do they find customers,0
it teaches a lesson to not be self centered,0
roland young reprises his role as topper that poor man who sees ghosts in this third topper movie the tv show would have leo g carroll in the title role,0
she convincingly fakes an american accent and hearst 's pain confusion and terror come through,0
no do n't shoot to you see the whites,0
this movie is based on the real story of that fight,0
that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie,0
we all enjoyed ourselves viggo is a downtoearth hero and the horse himself is adorable,0
wellacted even by elizabeth berkley,0

proving here just as he has done his entire career that range is not a problem for the actor,0
ryan 's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film,0
is one better than the other,0
the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie,0
not that it matters much to me but these are hardly alist names,0
and that 's good enough for me,0
it is obvious that he did n't,0
molly parker is an amazing actress in one movie she is a pregnant woman feeling the pain of the birth in the center of the world' she is very sexy showing a great versatility in acting,0
the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension,0
their should have been a warning on it saying it was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action adventure,0
the beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother,0
he does not tell anybody around him about his death,0
the laughs are n't there the message or morals are just all wrong and the film cant ever decide on whether its a comedy or drama,0
i am curious to see what he will do next,0
it shares some common flaws like having a plot that 's too predictable and linear for my taste,0
why they have no other work to do,0
instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so wellchosen so thumbs down for the productions of 1980 but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978,0
however the principal acting is a bit weak,0
it 's hilarious the way he is so clearly offended by their behavior as he tells them that they have that 'we ca n't just stand here and let this happen' look on their faces and says that now they have to leave,0
he saved the man 's life earlier why let him die now,0
tom 's character was really awful horrible script,0
the plot is good and has a lot of depth but i think it has some minor flaws,0
it 's tied together so well it just made sense i 've been one of those characters and maybe that 's why i connected so well with it,0
for the boys is for a reason i cannot discern one of my all time favorite movies,0
is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men,0
it also asks importantly how much can love forgive,0
however i thought this movie was dreadful,0
clark gable plays a really sweet caring guy who just happens to be a top mobster and coldblooded killer,0
this movie does stay true to it 's roots,0
there 's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good,0
this is rated for physical violence some gun violence mild gore some profanity and some adult situations,0
to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk,0
i could n't finish watching it and i guess nobody in his right mind would unless he 's desperate to see gay porn,0
the only semiinteresting part spoiler is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff 's office i say it 's interesting because at least she made good use of that liquor instead of stereotypically using it to start a fire to kill the bad guy although she did go that route towards the end,0
it 's ballsy at times,0
i have n't seen this movie in about 25 years so i really ca n't say that much about it,0
especially thora birch as liz the cool but always plotting girl who 's desperately in love with a guy,0
excellent performances and direction combine with an exemplary script,0
they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here,0
but lord of the piercing is not the title that you give to something that you expect to be entered into the short film hall of fame,0
costner plays his usual wise teacher character the only character he can play and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here,0
this production is an insult to the stooges especially moe,0
one would expect a film all about mobsters and hit men to at least be mildly interesting,0
the quickest solution to the poaching problem in tibet is for china to return tibet to its people and get out of tibet,0
vivek oberoi delivers his third great performance which is amazing for a newcomer,0
the teenage daughter of the lead counsellor who resents her father for dragging her along on these excursions and hates her stepmother,0
this movie is not what you would expect,0
this mistake of course keeps the movie going,0
i 'd avoid and look out for better efforts,0
shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel,0
we never even get a handle on the characters any resemblance between the way these people talk and behave and the way real people talk and behave is strictly coincidental,0
in other words he could have left any time he was neither tied threatened blackmailed nor physically abused apart from the sex which was supposed to be the punishment,0
just be aware that it is n't an action film,0
yash raj has given us great movies but something is missing now,0
it is a real mountain town west of denver,0
nothing deliberate or obvious or or it 's very difficult to describe,0
this show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time,0
the women are gorgeous and i have to say that i loved jane adams as the luminous nurse who happens to be hunchbacked,0
no in dresden both the germans and british except for bomber harris are innocent of a doctrine it is intimated created by the evil americans,0
instead of boring character development in an overlong equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going there 's not a single scene that 's a filler it 's balls to the wall plot,0
there 's a tarzan looking guy,0
alongside fawlty towers the greatest piece of tv ever,0
so i'm with the other people that voted for this show to continue on,0
i love kubrick and spielberg,0
why even put them in the movie,0
i ended up spending part of christmas night watching these shows,0
we had just bid farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years,0
they are red dwarf and always will be,0
we have just become so busy and fast paced we forgot the quieter days of yesteryear,0
they soon begin an affair,0
buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it,0
bridget cheerfully waves at the mirror,0
this movie due to it 's very ridiculous plot does not deserve such high ratings,0
it was sick and has all the earmarks of a snuff movie,0
he goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within,0
many horror fans complain that horror has scarcely progressed in the last twenty years,0
the greatest shortcoming of this series is perhaps the lack of an indepth story and associated cinematics that were in the past part and parcel of all command and conquer games,0
you cannot watch this short without laughing at something every 30 seconds,0
however the plot is just stupid and i was not once thrilled or scared while watching this,0
spunky newspaper columnist teams up with a grumpy detective to solve a series of vampire murders linked to a late night sex club,0
if you have n't checked this one out give it a try,0
godzilla was supposed to be the monster hit of 1998 overwhelming audiences with its hype and special effects,0

what some wo n't do for money,0
the plot concerns an inside woman on a stagecoach jewel robbery,0
brazil is the country of paradoxes and its social problems are present everywhere,0
this is a beautiful picture to watch,0
the look of this film is mainly grainy steady cam shots that inter cut with one another,0
acting and character writing is as well,0
if you 're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you then you ought to watch this film,0
at that point everything registers and the story makes sense unfortunately it 's not much fun getting to that point,0
he meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about,0
as i said the cast is poor the text is poor that it does n't help the actors,0
in conclusion i would like to say that i have always enjoyed watching carrie fisher act,0
the question is who is the target audience for the film,0
yeah i guess that life 's like that,0
you could argue that the ending is a little too perfect but it 's really not worth denying everything that 's great about the film for one trivial complaint,0
but they also needed an engaging story,0
characters are over exaggerated poor acting and as for a plot well it is utterly ridiculous,0
some of the films being made are amateurish others a bit more polished but at the heart of horror business is the degree of passion these artists feel about what they are doing,0
i was ten years old when i saw subspecies i instantly had the hots for michael watson and laura tate they really do have some great onscreen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie,0
in any case this one ranks among my top five,0
i feel bad for the actors tied to this project,0
the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there 's one person preaching his guts out to an audience,0
it begins with some young people at a party,0
mr reilly i shall miss you greatly,0
hell even watch one half of an episode,0
in the dvd 's commentary the people asked to comment on fellini 's work basically said that he was a genius,0
rachel york 's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful,0
in the 80 's it would have fit right in,0
you come out of the theater feeling happy passionate hurt proud all these things fall upon you watching this film,0
nowhere is essentially a simple story about high school life among a bunch of kids told through hyperbole,0
olive falls for bluto 's less than honorable attentions until he gets a little too physical and invariably blurts out hey babe how 'bout a kiss,0
it was the worst movie i 've ever seen,0
it seems as if very little thought went into any aspect of this film casting screen writing direction anything,0
they brought this movie forward to an extremely gullible and impressionable public who believes whatever they see on tv and they failed to show these black gangsters for what they truly are professional victims,0
i loved the first dragonheart,0
if you have to watch it watch it for the little girl 's acting,0
anyway i recommend this for anyone who likes trashy sleazy black and white horror films from the early '60 's,0
please do n't watch this movie,0
the subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut,0
teens may also enjoy it only the teens today are mostly into pg13 movies not necessarily g movies,0
the keep on ever going of using both blackwhite and color film that keep on switching is really annoying and very much unattractive,0
the scientist of a lab gets bitten by alien tissue and undergoes a transformation,0
there is n't a single truly funny moment here,0
well sorry to say but the same goes for the film,0
you 're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it,0
worse than all dean cain films combined,0
and the classmate guy who apparently has his eye on holmes always wondered why she never gave him the time of day,0
the film tries to place the problems of tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force,0
810 for an enjoyable time watching the movie,0
you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house,0
what is told is told fairly well,0
there is no real science in it mostly is just tries to amaze with doomsday scenarios where the earth is destroyed,0
bottom line do n't waste your time to go see this,0
the first summed up what beverly hills was like in the early 80 's but this one shows us the world indulgent americans live in when they have more money than they can spend,0
anything but do n't watch this awful flick,0
seriously we need to get organized about this,0
be warned though definitely an acquired taste,0
he does n't move his arms when he walks either,0
yes kind of odd that a universal pictures mysterythriller would be laced with boogie woogie tunes but surprisingly the numbers tie in well with the plot and are not overdrawn,0
to show that she is mentally ill she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she 's going mad,0
overall an extremely disappointing picture,0
but then we would not have had a movie then would we,0
the theme has been done almost annually in hollywood in one form or another,0
i'm just surprised that i had never seen it before this past weekend,0
there are those that actually enjoyed this film which just boggles my mind,0
then the next one comes up and i figure screw it and fast forward through it,0
where keaton did take risks however is in his physical daredevil comedy,0
what this movie is not cool entertaining what this movie is visually interesting difficult to get through intentional i feel that this movie puts the viewer through a clip of time where they experience a world without language,0
at first sight i must say already watch the contractor 2007 with wesley snipes too,0
there 's nothing pretty about this film but it stays with the viewer,0
conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die,0
i realize he did it because steve mcqueen was originally supposed to be in itbut that 's still a stupid reason,0
unfortunately i have seen that version only once but i do remember that the plot was striking and that sydney greenstreet in a rare sympathetic role was utterly memorable and just about stole the film,0
there could have been a better mix and match of their narrations,0
love your pets no matter what they do cherish them forever,0
this movie should have had psychological tension at least that since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible,0
he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures,0
if you are a not a turk and especially do not know anything about cem yilmaz then it would even seem silly to you,0
pandemonium is not up there with those films,0
i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis,0
if director eddie romero had just stuck with the wip theme he would have been fine,0
what 's that you say he is the director,0
i really would like to find more movies by the writerdirector stefan schwartz but there does n't seem to be anything recent on imdb,0
on top of that and maybe the worst crime it 's uninteresting and vastly predictable,0
and these were just the few seconds or so,0
most of all you admire the extraordinary bravery of a young boy who faces a terminal illness,0
impressing what the title proposes i mean,0
chuck us another shrimp because this one 's well and truly over done,0
kara unger is perhaps best of all had her role been developed beyond a few lines she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination,0
then we go to realtime lift shaft fun followed by some truly mawkish stuff in the hospital at the end,0
he does n't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer costello,0
if you think this is a love story you 're right,0
the language was very tame but most bond movies are pretty good in that department,0
most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years,0
i went to see it because i always liked robin hood and i saw the trailer of this movie and thought it was hilarious,0
the diversity from one story to another is creative and unique,0
after watching this film i think i should look at other films produced by this team of dream makers,0
why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me but the main character cherry is the director 's sister so that could be part of it,0
now they have 92 mins has some extra features,0
they most certainly do n't when having taken exception to a new firm member trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash,0
2 first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half,0
he stands there so proud of himself but is there any surprise that so many people would watch the most popular musical acts in the world,0
so anyways this movie is n't worth your 3 dollars to rent it and surprisingly its not made by ulli lommel,0
i'm hesitant to call it a giallo because the film does n't feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the mould and this would seem to be one of them,0
deciding your child is going to enjoy any film with animals and farts is what i 'd call neglect,0
the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers,0
real world issues dealt with blatant unoriginality,0
overall the storyline would have truly transformed this trilogy into an epic but whether it was lack of funds or lack of cameras this was the biggest let down i can remember,0
the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen,0
throughout the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot which may get annoying but its nothing that is out of control,0
all these people that change clothes like mission impossible but here is not really convincing,0
the story is silly and some of the special effects look rough around the edges but who cares,0
please save your money this movie can offer you nothing,0
i have read the other reviews however i cannot agree because this is a big hearted not light hearted comedy drama and there is plenty of chemistry between the stars annabella sciorra and matt dillon,0
patrick swayze is magnificent in his role as johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive,0
this movie is one of them,0
and how did they keep them so clean and sparkly,0
i gave it a 10 squarely on entertainment value,0
acting is top notch all around,0
i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too,0
last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicted 's last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed legal way,0
i watch this romantic comedy whenever it is on tv and i have no complaints about it at all,0
more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far exceeded my expectations,0
very disappointing for us norris fans,0
as i said the plot is simple,0
outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that 's in a film noir or crime movie,0
the acting is understated throughout with the exception of laura linney 's occasional shriek and raised eyebrows,0
people are often put off british films with reviews which begin with gritty or realistic but people should definitely give this film a try,0
you think this would be important yet kirk who is in contact with the government agents never relays this information to them,0
all you get to know is that the monster sucks goat 's blood,0
stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent,0
not that bruce willis liv tyler or anyone else in this godforsaken piece of garbage was much better,0
ties and left him bleeding to death and then went to work raping the other woman and then killing her,0
it 's not groundhog day or broken flowers but hey a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days but then it just does n't matter,0
i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but i just could n't do it,0
yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song andor dance sequences,0
my favorite characters are kate and chelsea even though they are n't known as the nicest people at least they they are believable,0
of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman,0
of course this is not really for everyone but anyone who wants a trip down memory lane or just wants to see how good trailers used to be rent this asap,0
some might say this means its magic is gone but i prefer the adult pacing that gives you something new and interesting happening every few minutes,0
it amazes me how much sorkin has in common with m night shyamalan they both have enviable raw talent are in love with their own works and yet try so hard you just know that they 're incredibly insecure about their own abilities,0
i was left speechless due to the amazingly dull story annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis and boring dialogue,0
the officers caught the spanish girls bringing rum on the ship and did not pay them,0
the transformers movie was nowhere near as violent as this movie was and even then at least the writers of the transformers movie waited until somewhere near the middle before they even started killing off characters,0
every aspect of it was godawful the writing was painfully dull the acting was nonexistent and the plot was so thin and contrived it was hard to believe it was n't an hourlong inside joke that i was regretfully unaware of,0
those words are perhaps the best sum up of the nature of the ocean i have ever heard muttered,0
virtual sexuality proves that britain can produce romantic comedies as vapid as those from america,0
the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago,0
that never happened in the end which disappointed me to no end,0
only if you 're really bored,0
your'e much better off showing your kids the vintage sweet simple care bear films,0
is it as bad as everybody says it is,0
it was a great movie and had great actors and i do n't see why it was taken off the air,0
although made in 1936 the mandarin mystery 's story pace camera work themes and sets have the feel of a late 1950s tv mystery show,0
many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme bigotry,0
so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah 's ark,0
in addition the musical score is done by someone who obviously was n't actually watching the movie at the time because it 's random enough to cause whiplash,0
same thing goes for the music the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end,0
all these stunts are fantastic but it 's scary to think that any one of these probably could 've killed keaton if something even went slightly wrong,0
absolutely no basis in reality,0
it 's not even unintentionally funny,0
and that 's about it folks,0
at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously,0
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was,0
having been a fan of all things ridiculous from a very young age i could n't believe my eyes when one evening a friend and i sat down to watch some trashy horror rubbish and what greeted us was this,0
go see it and love it,0
she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity,0
some of the worst least natural acting performances i 've ever seen,0
one can only assume they all had property there,0
ted 's evaluation 2 of 3 has some interesting elements,0
every time one of them asks a question they have to repeat it about 5 times the others travelers are permanently depressed and silent,0
it does n't and that just leads to more confusion,0
the violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the triad is a violent criminal organisation,0
but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting,0
this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it,0
because this film is aimed strictly at kids here the writers wrote a script that 's full of easy and illogical contrivances,0
however i thought that margaret was an absolute b,0
it makes me wonder how it got financial backing,0
first of all irish actor pierce brosnan as a native american,0
cheadle has infiltrated these terrorists lead by sad taghmaoui who also played a terrorist earlier in 2008 in vantage point so deeply he 's afraid that he 'll have carried out attacks against the us before daniels gets what he wants,0
there is to say the least a serious mismatch of styles,0
if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you 'll never come across this film,0
this kind of urge is n't like drugs alcohol cigarettes etc because this is an urge that we were born having,0
this film cannot lie itself exactly on what its gene is,0
i do n't know how other viewer think about this movie,0
the big bad of the show naraku while starting out as a really good bad guy lost his touch after a while,0
just very disjointed and nonsensical,0
it makes the movie and its story overall a pretty realistic one though perhaps a bit predictable since the movie does n't quite offer anything original enough within its genre,0
the haunting and mythical music is composed by alexandre desplat,0
every dime of that money should go to zach for keeping his cool and not smothering flo in her sleep,0
as i recall it seems like the film were presented by the armstrong circle theatre,0
some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen,0
all that is of course completely irrelevant the question is not whether the play is faithful to the source material but whether it 's good,0
course it is thanks to its wonderfully executed characters that makes this film such a memorable experience,0
i think that if it did n't have those laughs you would n't laugh at all,0
i got half way through and switched off completely bored,0
the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit,0
let 's to say that the actors really are american living in america why would they then work on a swedish movie like edward did,0
peter weir surpassed himself too with his work in this film,0
a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips,0
however if your expecting dazzling special effects and quality action to save the day your better off watching a power point presentation at the office,0
their sexual union seems to rob the healer of his ability to help the little boy when his cancer returns,0
as much as it pains me to say mr yuzna seems to have hit a bit of a slump,0
the costume designer should never be allowed to work again,0
one can have look at what they talk,0
ronnie is a sad sack loser of a guy who works at a halfway house for the mentally disabled,0
the material is poor the script 's dreadful the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head,0
i think this movie will draw more into the indie scene,0
do n't get me wrong i love horror movies but this movie is a horror,0
waste of time do not bother with this garbage you will regret it,0
first things first who in they 're right minds talk like they do,0
while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast is an additional plus,0
maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date,0
the sex scenes i assume are supposed to be funny but i find myself asking who has sex like that,0
there is nothing i hate more in a movie than pretentiousness and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made,0
julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays,0
without revealing the brilliant twists at the end allow me to say that this film explores trust ideology and friendship in a way that is funny and poignant,0
alda 's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that slate injects into all the movies,0
this has to be the worst piece of monkey s i have ever seen,0
the idea of the kind policeman jack friar trying to investigate something for a neighbor brings him into a situation that will ensnare him as he discovers the people in the house are planning a caper and take him prisoner,0
god this was one of the worst ever,0
the first battle is around 1 minute and shows just nothing,0
the soundtrack is great it really plays up the isolation fear and gravity of the situation,0
it 's not too shoddy either,0
brooks gets an inordinate amount of attention and praise simply because she was a big feminist before her time so liberals gush over anything she did even it stinks,0
from the start you know this is a sam sherman film more than an al adamson film because as the credits roll a sam sherman production appears in letters as big as the title credit,0
the plot also turns out to lack any depth,0
but both of them never knew how far they will go for sealing documents for a living and since they are both amateurs,0
the sets are beautiful but it 's so dark and gloomy and after a while you start missing daylight,0
but when a deal goes wrong a young woman is kidnapped and is witnessed by fraser a young man who 's been following her around photographing her,0
wish the sesame street parodies were on line,0
that '80s show in my opinion is an absolute fox classic,0
and this is what makes the movie so ultimately tragic and emotionally jarring that true love is consciously allowed to be crushed in lieu of family tradition which is the overwhelming hypocrisy of the people inhabiting edith wharton 's timeless novel,0
i do n't recommend anybody to watch this,0
unfortunately it 's not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy,0
the story was truly well done and the director is to be commended,0
james gandolfini has a simple non violent role vincent d'onofrio is absolutely wonderful in his adoring song to ms sciorra,0
there is nothing positive i can say about this movie,0
who has been hired to track him down and bring him back for justice,0
anderson so far has n't made a bad movie and so i hope that he does n't disappoint with fantastic mr fox,0
you can believe it or not anyway this is the book 's version then you ca n't be critical with the movie about this be with the book,0
i have not read the novel upon which this film is based,0
not even some well composed shots of the bygone twin towers can elicit genuine emotional responses,0
towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed,0
if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead,0
this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different,0
the mixture of show business and religion loyalty and friendship are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies,0
the whole idea of being able to so easily steal the declaration of independence and run around all over washington dc and philadelphia with it while fighting the bad guys and experiencing what is supposed to be nonstop action is absurd,0
it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription,0
it uses natural empathy with the plight of the jewish refugees as a tool to stir antiamerican feelings,0
i do n't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew it 's just that after watching things like the wire i 've come to expect great things from cop drama,0
while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right it 's tacky that the creators of that 70s show keep trying to imitate it,0
congrats for weisz brody ruffalo and especially rinko kikuchi the japanese oscar nominee for babel,0
it is a great contribution to the local film industry and films like these with high quality deserve good production and not only support for the commercial mainstream in the philippines but also in cinemas worldwide,0
for having more potential than almost any film in the last decade and releasing this stank pickle i give avp 110,0
it 's not all that bad but not as quick and snappy as the last 2 i watched the first quarter hour of it and then skipped forward to the last quarter hour and found that it still made sense and really i had n't missed a thing,0
it 's not your typical well anything,0
this is an underrated decent little thriller,0
she locks him inside her house with her and proceeds to berate him,0
julia roberts plays a reporter named catherine and she 's interviewing an actor named nicholas but while on his flight he finds a love letter and thinks catherine slipped it into his bag,0
it will lift you to the heights of what we can do with our lives when we get outside of ourselves and invest ourselves in other people,0
while watching another indie horror flick i 'd made up my mind that i need to start reviewing indies as a separate entity from hollywood films they simply ca n't compare,0
not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme,0
good actors an excellent script an interesting premise,0
i thought the intellectual chess game between anthony hopkins and ryan gosling was pure joy,0
i look forward to following her career planned for the future,0
he should know jeff is bisexual and seems more interested in robert 's sword than his pen,0
we give mr lang and 20th centuryfox a rating of,0
great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is is simply ignored,0
when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language where was the gore,0
perhaps the biggest flaw within the film is just how flat and uninspired the main characters are,0
not only that but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time,0
amazing 's secret identity stiller 's rage garofalo 's desire to avenge her father,0
she asked me what i meant and i said this water was it wet,0
the first reviews which drew me to watch kekexili compared it to the great american westerns so i 'll start with the differences,0
this title is probably more suited to males that have brothers but definitely is not exclusive to this group,0
i feel that if i look down i will see the tattered remains of the person i was before i saw this movie floating in a pool of my lost humanity,0
i bet the scenes inspired tripe like harry potter,0
the english patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise,0
there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie,0
this movie is n't as fresh as the original movie but i found myself laughing alot throughout,0
if this is america 's future maybe we would be better off under the taliban,0
fact is there was more art in those wild leaps the fab four performed in a hard day 's night than in a single frame of petulia,0
there is a lot more nudity than you get in most scifi but it really is required to get the plot to work,0
the story was told much better 70 years ago and kept my interest all the way,0
agar beaumont and a truly dumb slave girl named adele escape the carnage by the attacking mole people by climbing up a hole that leads to the surface,0
the rest of the commandos are made up of disgusting excons,0
it is interesting that the last lines of the film were lieutenant dave at least we 've got it stopped,0
ca n't he just use his gun,0
we see a whole bunch of americans losing their jobs because their jobs have been outsourced to india,0
just not the carpenters they 're sacred,0
one day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients,0
six years later he cast albert brooks in the very successful broadcast news,0
when they find one all three of them will have good luck they believe,0
but it all just gets too convoluted,0
i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie,0
a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film,0
the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thrillerhorror movies,0
then immediately they cut to an american flag waving and patriotic music playing and a shot of the kid hugging his proud father with a screen that said the end brought to you by the nra,0
but you 'll regret later,0
civil defense people leave work and go to their stations,0
perhaps if you make into the second hour there is something worth seeing,0
this time on the big screen,0
well worth seeing again and again,0
beside that the film is to long with an unnecessary long ride in the truck and a stupid ending in italy,0
this is how hollywood typically does it but it does n't work here,0
stock footage and library music are reused here as well,0
anyway i wish bela lugosi or john carradine had played the part,0
do not neglect this film,0
i really believe a fourth grader could have written better dialog and plot,0
this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script,0
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us would order a navy lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers and report only to the president that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film,0
while discussing the complex problems in the middle east ellie asks burns are you the kind of person who knows what is exactly right and what is wrong,0
or if the director wanted to kill batman with a whimper rather than a bang he succeeded,0
the film was based on a graham greene story and his perfect observation of the british way of life is superbly translated to the screen,0
in the play iago gets tortured at the end but in the film he gets his satisfaction and gets othello 's position,0
it 's probably better that he did n't attempt one but all the other characters of the film speak in an english accent,0
true it 's been to recent to come up with a big movie about 911,0
not that this matters however as halfway through the film the writers decided that the story was no longer about the cult and just made it about this weird sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and his client,0
carlos also tries to make fun of current events but lacks creativity or originality,0
hilary swank gives an outstanding performance with a superb supporting cast,0
handsome long who would find success in television makes a good impression in his first film,0
the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit,0
at least i was entertained,0
lelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia kaas,0
version of applause playing the gay hairdresser and friend of margo channing played by lauren bacall,0
i never expected miss lohan to be that believable in her two parts in the movie with all the bad publicity that she 's gotten over the last two years as an out of control drug and alcohol abuser,0
look again beauty turns up in the oddest places,0
it also received widespread critical acclaim,0
we then follow the fortunes of two fbi men that come into town to investigate the disappearance,0
like i said the plot if mediocre,0
the movie was also less interesting because it did not say what he was thinking so you did n't feel as attached to him and a lot of the stuff he thought was important or interesting,0
the story admittedly is a little thin and some times too emotional but still it was nice to watch,0
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i 've seen some bad ones,0
normally i am not the best judge of acting talent,0
4 too many plot holes a lot of scenes do n't add up,0
our sexy adventurers do n't know how to cave but they sure know how to smirk,0
rating 810 for a comedy,0
to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series oz and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress,0
that it is dangerous to be a lesbian very dangerous,0
his reserve seems very accurate and is reminiscent of dan rather and nic robertson,0
the stories and i use the world loosely are incoherent and do make any sense at all,0
even if they did this via some voice of god commentary and photos it would of been ok the animations were good but again i felt these were used as filler they did n't really do anything other than allow me to hear his music and see some imagery based on the dimension 5 records,0
the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time,0
i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung,0
after getting the tank blown up by a bazooka he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet,0
he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met,0
give it up mr w it 's time for a career change i hear they 're hiring at mel 's diner,0
images without words are used to convey the story,0
do n't be intrigued like i was by the title this is a movie that 's seriously bad,0
there are several other scenes that were ripped off from other movies,0
krishna notices a change in gauri but not a single line of dialogue is said,0
chico organized his own big band and went that route to keeping busy,0
for example there is a character called inspector henderson and at the end of the show the superman cape is shown with a red s just as it was on george reeve 's costume whereas superman 's actual cape has a yellow s,0
how many movies are going to use frightmare as a title,0
the character depth derived in this film is amazing,0
sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a cgrade movie,0
something about that 70s camerawork makes these things look even more disturbing than today 's filmmakers are capable of producing,0
if i wanted computer animation i would have watched some pixar arts not this waste of time,0
it seems to want to send a message but it does not know how to,0
broken english has nothing to do with the movie,0
but jealousy and resentment raise their heads and he finds himself in a world of brutal revenge,0
hume cronyn an actor that worked with hitchcock in a few movies is good as sparks,0
static direction by tod browning does n't help,0
as the first person to die on the stroke of midnight holm must become the driver of the phantom carriage and collect souls during the new year,0
i like the music in the shorts,0
the tramp goes to highclass restaurants and dances to get his dog spot from the pound passing his hat around at the end,0
but i recommend this movie to your buddies whom you do n't like,0
what people say is of little importance anyway since it only serves them as a mask of sound to cover what they really are and you can always see it in their actions that never lie,0
still if you 've read gone with the wind you would see that children make no difference in scarlett 's world,0
there had been some mildly amusing humour but at best a barebones plot and a general sense of pointlessness that was on the verge of making me think that i was wasting my time,0
efron does n't know much but i know horses like me,0
while this is a great slasher movies it does have the flaws of almost all slasher films,0
it tries to be something it is not,0
as you can see realism has no place in this film,0
and it does not necessarily imply the lady loves to be tortured,0
the sheer brilliance of the acting along with the spectacular cinematography which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film makes 'apocalypse now' an unforgettable epic,0
even though they 've been hiking together for some time they sit down and introduce themselves to each other,0
alright i got passed the horrible acting,0
this movie is a mustsee movie for all,0
personally i loved supernatural ever since the pilot but it 's still very encouraging and stimulating to see how the show gets better with each and every episode,0
dolph the director is in very good form,0
very sad that people make the exact movie twice with the same script and that only a few years after the first one,0
and thats probably the weakest joke of them all,0
in general i like movies where characters do n't act rationally but with this movie i could n't create any explanation for some events and the main character is n't completely insane so i should have been able to follow some type of reason,0
seeing his problem jim decides to take the entire family out to the lake for the weekend to make up for his mistakes,0
unlike other mystery thrillers the audience is alerted to who the perpetrator is almost immediately,0
being american i have not been exposed to this character before which is good because some of you have been disappointed,0
the producing who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb,0
i have n't seen all his films but in the ones i 've seen he imparts a strong masculinity which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier,0
however he undergoes a major change of heart once frank brand a coldblooded outlaw and his nasty gang cause a ruckus in his town and lead to the deaths of kilpatrick 's wife and son,0
the script bears little resemblance to the real lives of the two comedians however even if it was 100 accurate and costello actually was the ogre the movie paints him to be the horrendous miscasting of buddy hackett and harvey korman destroys whatever possibilities the movie might have had,0
however i can imagine if you are looking from that perspective you will see some,0
those familiar with kim kiduk 's films will no doubt find this to be true to his directing form slow pacing subtle performances first class cinematography a simplistic story and very little dialog,0
the movie tries to ridicule the chinese system one american hero and a chinese altruistic lawyer in a bland film,0
if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most workable edition i 've seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps and it 's an unedited and complete european version which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from fury 's print,0
she wanders the mall sees an old friend from college tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined gosh maybe her husband is grumpy because he 's going broke but that 's too complicated for the script to follow,0
i must admit that i felt really antiamerican after watching the movie and before finding out that it did n't really happen that way,0
it 'll be probably be as complicated than an alfred hitchcock film,0
jezebel is n't even nowhere close in the same league and epic proportions as gone with the wind and jezebel is a more light and less complicated one that has a totally different style and breaths a total different atmosphere not in the least also since gone with the wind is a movie in color of course,0
this film reminded me of a sort of mix between sunset blvd,0
if you like parodies and enjoy say leslie nielsen or mike myers you 're gonna love this,0
let 's face it none of the batman movies had a very good ending fight,0
i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better,0
the characters' actions and the progression of the events go through looks and gestures,0
yes donnie yen has codirected it,0
by the end of this i could really care less about the wolfen 's back story,0
they look like cheap little blue copies of jabba the hutt,0
once they arrive at a private estate the ladies begin to unwind a little and enjoy the pool complete with new bathing suits for each of them,0
you just solved the puzzles and moved on in your quest,0
tyrone power was cast in the lead as solomon,0
this movie for me was a real eye opener not only in regards to the treatment of people under the rule of a military regime but life in general in afghanistan,0
if you like this one i recommend starship troopers 2 hero of the federation,0
i was so impressed with animal that weeks later i searched to buy a vhs version for at least one hour at a local movie rental house,0
dee is spunky teen who gets in over her head in more ways than one hanging out with the older guy surfers,0
what i watched was a film that was full of bad writing wooden acting and an uninspired story,0
the jump cuts used are poorly done and film school students would do a much better job,0
napoleon dashes in to liberate spain,0
in fact everyone involved here deserves a if not physical then atleast a verbal lash or two,0
this film surely deserves recognition for demonstrating the evils of racial prejudice and rumor in an effective and entertaining fashion,0
it made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film,0
only watch meet the deedles if there 's nothing on tv,0
there is n't much else here,0
or the guy who wanted his garage demo 'd so he hired the job to a guy who sold it to get rid of it,0
this movie might be fun at a boozy frat party but only if no other options were available,0
i have seen many versions of the play in my life both on stage and screen,0
family film we 've seen for decades now,0
it seems there are two kinds of people in the world those who think that five characters is one of the best episodes in the series and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so clever and already predicted the lame twist at the end,0
even lagaan was 4 hours long but it was entertaining and gave a message as well,0
i totally understand why without spoiling anything the overall message of the movie is shocking,0
sounds bleak but it is n't,0
hangman is a somewhat interesting thriller with some good things but too many horrible mistakes that completely bury any enjoyment from the viewer and most of all any value the movie could have,0
the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency than any traumatic occurrence,0
this film has such a great cast de niro helena bonham carter ian holm tom hulce and director branaugh but all fail miserably here mostly thanks to this monster of a script,0
yet with all the viewing of the effect of the film industry 's changes on the lives of actors few tackled that of production people,0
i was thinking to myself while watching it why am i putting myself through a second viewing,0
nice job matching the tone to the original movie while updating the story itself,0
we very seldom go to the theater and he loved the film,0
final thoughts this suspense filled made for tv movie was made in 1978 so do n't expect many deaths,0
check it out my humble opinion on to die for 8510,0
the kill bike action was ridiculous,0
it had glamorous settings exquisite fashions beautiful women and intriguing often ground breaking plots,0
although i think it 's one of the rare films i 've seen and it 's really good i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it,0
there 's no tension either between characters or in the society,0
warning possible spoilers starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that 's all the more annoying for talking nonsense it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama,0
if nick nolte martin short had played the parts it might have been bearable but maybe not,0
the one of the most remarkable scifi movies of the millennium,0
if you love one of these you will love cowboy bebop,0
that being said nbc sci fi may have another winner on their hands,0
randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead,0
he 's not afraid to let things get ugly really ugly down right squalid,0
acting diabolical plot _ diabolical dialogue diabolical lighting diabolical continuity you guessed it diabolical,0
i remember seeing this movie on the shelves at my local video store 15 years ago,0
this is on the comedy shelf of my film library,0
it 's difficult to watch a movie about evil characters trying to kill heather when you know she died as a kid in real life,0
turn it off when the pair are in bliss and you wo n't have to go through the inevitable plot pain,0
the quick pace the interesting camera movements for sure,0
overall this movie had bad writing and cheap sets,0
i recommend this to anyone,0
turns out she 's a dyke with a secret crush on marie which drove her insane,0
so new york has been transformed into a lawless hellhole where murderers rule the streets and from which escape is impossible,0
she is a hard worker a loving mother but mostly a shell of character one who cries on cue but rarely projects any substance,0
anyway she meets the rest of the people there,0
which of course does n't start,0
acting and parts of the story is worth 710 votes historically 110 so my final vote will be a 4 out of 10 i hope the mini series become an inspiration for others to make more movies in the same genre,0

a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article but i say again a minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating,0

there is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show ronald colman playing the role of othello,0
happy gilmore is adam sandler 's only standout performance in a long list of halfassed unfunny comedies,0
however for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and disinterested,0
i for one own the movie on dvd,0
the cylons meanwhile attack again but are destroyed because they 're so utterly incompetent,0
it would have worked better if he was a moron,0
this show 's characters were extremely irritating,0
first off i thought the gamers would be a little younger usually people that old do n't game do they,0
it 's unflinching in its candor and ultimately unforgettable,0
hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom 100,0
also do n't bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but is n't,0
this movie is a dog from start to finish and it 's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it,0

peter griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others,0
mainly reading comments of other people about movies ive or not seen,0
remember that this movie was made with the added stress of a reality television show looking over their shoulders,0
people other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in lynch 's eraserhead for example,0
there is a lot of clichd useless talk,0
i 've seen the film only once in a theater and became so engrossed with the story i completely forgot i was in it,0
good beginning and middle but ending could have been better,0

feeling that his death was in vain and seeing how her women 's institute is planning on raising money for a charitable cause annie and her friend chris decide to pose nude for a calendar,0
i'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today,0

the main subject is child abuse which is never fun to see a sordid topic,0
i adore the music and will have to see if i can run down a cd of it,0
i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick something else picks up or makes up for the weakness,0

this show has cough william shatner,0
director milius nails his allegiances down here there are some really nauseating scenes of gross patriotism which i found rather laughable,0
the last vignette when anastasia falls in love was also cute,0
as the plot of the episode moves along we are introduced to a new character ava is somehow connected with sam,0
now that we have bruce lee a warrior 's journey there 's no need to even go back and revisit this one,0
this film had some potential however its seedy undertone and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be its downfall,0
i 'll followup as soon as i get a chance to sit down and watch that one,0
the best thing about the movie is the cinematography but even the dark landscape of the cave becomes soon boring because the film lacks pace and the characters are simply not interesting,0
a group of normal college kids from chicago all unanimously agreed that this film was complete trash,0
the whole cast is excellent and the sensual open tone of the movie mixing the fairly straightlaced couple their young child middle class friends and family and the worldly young man and depicting them ultimately as not really all that different is almost comforting until that ending which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development shattering the mood,0
it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful,0
all three were used one after another after another,0

when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie,0
the reasons why this film is most likely a cult hit is because binder put together a surprisingly diverse cast who seem to happily goof their way through this less than professional outing,0
i ca n't describe how bad this is i felt a little embarrassed,0
hand to hand with germans soviets were exterminating polish nation aimed at people who constituted the backbone of poland,0
the problem i think is that it all does n't seem to amount to much,0

sarah and mehdi have an open relationship and are allowed to have affairs with others,0
this movie is non stop action,0
the rights to this film were rescued from disney,0

but still not a good movie,0
to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement,0
here we have the third instalment of the urban legend franchise this time changing it up,0
what does that leave us with,0
i 've always said that robert trebor gave just a terrific performance,0
only the pacing and tone remain consistent,0
shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off,0
i was sold on the promise of action with segal and stealth aircraft which normally make for an entertaining action movie,0

i feel like finding out who the reviewer on the cd cover was that said it 's better than shaun of the dead,0

which you wo n't because you ca n't possibly expect what happens,0

if you enjoy bad movies go for it,0
the serpent dragon 's actions itself was very poorly written and the serpent dragon 's attack capabilities varied widely throughout the movie several times the main characters should have died,0
she could talk to the apes and so on,0
the general' is a lot more than slapstick,0
they were in fact supposed to end the film with a live concert but this turned into the rooftop performance,0
in the last 3 andre seemed to have kind of been mentioned but the stories never really focused on him which made me mad,0

this movie should have won the national award and would have been my pick to represent india at the oscars,0
i got this film off a friend and he didnt want it back its so bad,0

then we see zombies who attack and they both turn into zombies,0
a number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series,0

what i appreciated most was the concept the idea behind this film,0
i had the honor of experiencing miss richards in person reciting do n't be afraid of the dark,0
judging by the high imdb rating i'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress,0
but this film is a total disaster,0
remember the target audience right,0
then it would be at least interesting,0
i could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though,0
no if you have conservative leanings you probably wo n't like this film one bit,0
she was to strong to stay,0
read the other reviews to see why,0
she 's hung over and does n't remember anything from the previous evening not even marrying a total stranger,0
that said it 's not a bad film,0
it runs slowly and peacefully til the end with nothing interesting in it,0
the very material the director wanted to bring to a wider audience was destroyed as was all decency of this movie,0
all in all it 's a good collaborative effort from all concerned,0
most of the acting was awful lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one,0
children and wives depart many times before his life comes to an end he seems to blame god for all his misfortune and god does win in the end,0
she is effortless in her return to the screen,0
first of all all of the names were changed from the original book version which i hate,0

it is its faithfulness to the original that makes this drama so good,0
i do n't think the boss allowed his songs to be used here because he needed the money,0

this film puts it all out there,0
the more the film progressed the more i realized that this was a b movie at best,0

one of his earlier films el dia de la bestia aka,0
i mean when we watch ghostbusters for example we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened,0
he and his partner stand to make a cool million if the plan works,0
to me it was worth watching more than once so i 'll give it an 8 on imdb,0
the original show had been one of my favorites but i have always felt that it never achieved its full potential,0
most of the time is spent on useless shots such as a minute zoom shot on a shirt lying on a road,0
although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience,0
there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out,0
robert wagner plays the president and adds nothing special to the role that an unknown actor could have,0
i found the mom 's performance painful to watch as well as the grieving drunkard mom of the drowned boy,0
however andreas ca n't really seem to fit in and starts to long back to his old world and tries with all means to get back,0

so they compromised with schulz 's family making the latest peanuts special a charlie brown valentine from a conglomeration of numerous loosely connected comic strips penned by schulz,0
tudor is the only person in this movie who manages to prove some acting talent,0
there was nothing prior to those frames to indicate even basic competence on the filmmaker 's part much less a potential masterpiece,0
this is not your blood and guts horror slasher fest,0
oh yeah and what happened to george kennedy he used to be great,0
this was a modernday version of a 1940s narrative gangster film also known as film noir but with a different twist,0
that 's why i admire it,0
i have n't seen a lot of umberto lenzi 's movies but to me it seems he 's just a mediocre italian director when it comes to horrormovies,0
sound muddled and much of the acting is amateurish but a great story,0
she teaches charlie ethics by pointing out his gambling lying and stealing,0
the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm 's length away,0
was adapted to an african american family from a jewish one when it made the transition off stage and onto screen,0
it left me a bit confused but mostly disappointed that the filmmakers seemed to rap this film up at the end without really taking time to make the ending as unsettling as the first 34 of it,0
this time out aging charlie 's paul kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city,0
anytime i see time travel stories in movies or tv shows one of the most interesting things to me is how the actual time travel is presented,0
queasy confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of poprock tunes but characters one would hope to avoid,0
i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was 10000 and they were way under,0
michael mann certainly is the mann as even with the great acting the film would have been very dull with out the direction of mann,0
alexander gray and bernice clare possess fine light opera voices and there 's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along,0
the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing,0
usually i 'll watch any movie through if i 've made it past 30 mins but not this one,0
large 's performance was one of the stronger parts of the film,0
that being said i could win 10000000 in the lottery be jumping for joy and full of life would still be a stinker,0
overall i would give it a 7 out of 10,0
honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything,0
john phillip law and don stroud are both stiff in their acting and miscast for their roles,0
instead of just being a rampaging beast grendel is almost something to be pitied a misshapen outcast with noisy neighbours and his final scene is remarkably touching,0
she cast it with one hand and the other came out stuck in the wall upon landing and i assumed she was holding her staff in it so why was it not stuck in the wall too,0
i am not a sucker for cheap tv disney movies,0
the film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life,0
or did you go to the high school that had middleaged people teaching in it,0
too many sequels suffer from deja vu,0
you know she is going to be a factor,0
i do feel this one is more of a comedy than action or science fiction as martin short steals the show as the guy who ends up getting dennis quaid 's character shot into his buttocks,0
so while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf it 's definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though,0
but my snowboarding son is watching and i can tell he is not impressed,0
the concept of reincarnation and mulder somehow being involved in it is completely ridiculous,0
still the trademark altman audio style is evident here and there,0
is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters,0
there is nothing watchable there except for a study of very ancient film,0
i rented this movie not expecting much and that is a good thing because this film is a real stinker,0
i wonder how the dreamer mark regards this documentary,0

she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company,0
would love to see it again own it dvd or vhs show my young friends nephews and nieces,0
if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that fine,0
plastic skeletons and terrible acting do not help in saving this film from being placed onto the worst films of all time list,0
i was disappointed when i discovered it was n't,0
it is so good that although there are many talented supporting actors rosalind russell is the pivotal character,0
it jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction,0
the grey zone is a poetic and masterful holocaust drama based on the true story of jews who did the seemingly unthinkable by working for the nazis inside concentration camps for a chance to receive better living conditions and the possibility of staying alive for a few extra months before being exterminated themselves,0
this movie is just crap,0

what does this have to do with the other great movies,0
the movie works very well for the majority of the film the cast is extremely strong and the movie is by no means ever dull,0
i would thoroughly recommend to those who want just a little depth to stories in the cinema,0
yes this is biology but they will never tell it is,0
and the ending is probably the worst of it its supposed to be thoughtprovoking but the only thought that entered my mind is what the fk is going on,0
interestingly enough the commentary is far better than the actual film,0
i would pay any one 100 if they could send me a copy taken in the 1966 version,0
well i tend to watch films for one of three reasons,0
did we really need so many pumpkinhead films,0
if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny,0

i was yawning and checking the time,0
some of the things you 'll see in this movie will amaze you,0
the plot is good but is never really expanded,0
so maybe it is a question of fashion,0
it 's a strange combination where you as the viewer are thrown about and manipulated like those in the story line itself but one that works surprisingly well,0
some comments also state that granny should be younger when the looney tunes were toddlers,0
after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up,0
but then the film has yet another surprise for us laughton 's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where mary realizes along with the rest of us that he 's actually completely insane,0
i know i sound sexist in this next comment but i'm really not,0
the dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie is imbued with meaning,0
could n't be those disgusting humanlike furniture be avoided,0
it 's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing to see it,0
it may be that i'm reading too much into this documentary and that in turn the directors read too much into crowhurst but i found that sense as spellbinding as the other secrets kept in this film,0
you will absolutely hate her and want to kill her yourself,0
if you do that you will be rewarded,0
everyone seems to get their life back but was it the right choice,0
totally unconvincing from start to finish,0
shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100 more class,0
two thumbs up to the writer,0
seriously i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me,0
i was the production accountant on this movie and i also got to do some voiceover work on it so i'm not entirely unbiased but if it were awful i would say so,0
for myself a particular favorite from this film would be when the professor lectures on morals and so forth and buuel cuts to a sequence where the kitchen and bathroom swap roles both brilliant and comedic,0
look at better luck tomorrow,0
poor acting poor characterization poor dialog too much overbearing music too long,0
i'm white myself but it 's giving off the exact stereotype white people have on asian people,0
whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience,0
although perhaps a bit too scary in places for more sensitive youngsters gremlins is great fun for monster movie addicts of all ages,0
thankfully they gave the music thing a rest,0
fuller 's direction the great acting of vincent price and wong 's camera makes this a remarkable film,0
she befriends a young pirate who the others want to hang for skimming the take and together they set about trying to prevent another robbery,0

lon chaney jr plays the son of dracula,0
i suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s,0
and when did that happen,0

i honestly do n't know if this movie was intentionally this bad but my gut tells me it was n't,0
to travolta fans it is not his film it is film about true love between robin and sean,0
i have watched my share of looney toons shows even though i was born in 1993 and i know enough to know that these feminine characters only appear once in a great while on the looney toons,0

i did n't expect much from the movie so am not all that disappointed,0
the soundtrack is essentially one long song which plays throughout the film changing and stopping as the emotion calls for,0

i will also avoid mentioning the spoton satire office space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe,0

there 's no need to say more about the plot since the rest will play out in part 2 what really impresses is how roddenberry creates the connection between the cage and the rest of the star trek universe by coming up with a particular type of flashback that allows everyone on screen and off to see what could have been of trek had nbc not turned down the original project,0
well done people a really enjoyable experience,0

he however is overrun by his obsession with his late wife 's memory,0
this movie deserves a 95 out of 10 in the make fun of the movie with your buddies category,0
and it does n't hurt that the screenplay was co written by raymond chandler himself who knows something about economy and clever dialog,0
the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it were n't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings,0
the scene that she felt the need to separate her stuff apart from her partner 's right before her partner 's nephew arrival certainly reflects how lesbians are practically nonexistent at that time,0

the freedom to sell your wares wherever possible but what am i saying,0
a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary,0
as a native texan i grew up with the mythology,0
overall this film is hilarious,0
i wonder why this game lasted so briefly,0
and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apart,0
being a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the rich and famous part between the two,0
i enjoyed the final scene with the actor chad everett playing the still grieving jimmy only much older by now and clearly still missing his former partner coop,0
i thought this was a very good tv series and i would like to see it continue,0
and special mention must be made of veteran character actor paul koslo as the maniacal russian villain whether he is ruthlessly stomping on his helpless opponents after they 've already surrendered or complaining that their close proximity to him in a bar has caused his vodka to taste like blood he is clearly having a ball and the film benefits enormously whenever he is onscreen,0
i recommend this movie to anyone who does n't mind subtitles comedy is a language in itself,0
they decide lloyd just might be a better patsy than the guy who just died,0

i had to watch it all the way through just to see what new depths would be plummeted,0
for example the name should scream do n't watch,0

or maybe he was ill or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place so what the heck,0
this is a sad day in all movie genres,0
the budget for this movie must have been nearly nonexistent and the shooting schedule i would guess ran somewhere around 2 hours and 13 minutes,0
finally in the last scene you also get to see norman naked running across the sand and looking frozen,0
many of the smaller facts were disregarded but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of racist judges is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to giardello,0

the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures,0
why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know,0
ok so i 've seen lots of rubbish films but what sticks in the mind with this one is the level of money and the cast involved,0
i watched this movie because the idea was intriguing,0
and she was at this time around 50 years old,0
films this bad are rare,0

sean hayes stinks as jerry lewis,0
maybe good enough for a rainy saturday afternoon maybe,0
i know the whole stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this,0

for years i have come home from school and watched this quality australian soap,0
i believe the movie was typical yet good,0
it 's kinda funny when you think about it,0

this is the goofiest film i 've ever seen in my life,0
director and playwright richard day adapted his own stage material for the screen clearly inspired by rock hudson 's reallife dilemma from the 1950s what to do with a screen idol who is secretly homosexual,0

the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers who took a good story and made it tedious,0
she could have done this at any time but it feels like she did n't until it was convenient for the writers,0

it was wonderfully made the acting the cinematography it was a really cool movie,0
we do n't get to know them hence we do n't get to care for them,0
dubbed into english and released by hemisphere pictures in 1971 as the bottom of a double bill with his frequent collaborator eddie romero 's beast of blood it looked to the world like any other low budget drivein nonsense,0

i 've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play,0
some of the lines were priceless but the timing was also important and the team must take full credit for their part,0
i saw this film in a cinema in italy in dolby surround,0
i would recommend it to anyone from any culture with any background,0

so i think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfy a critic in ourselves,0
i have the dvd and it 's terrible,0
i had the chance to briefly meet the writerdirector and he is amazing,0
the other actors and actresses were great as well,0
also the voices of chucky an tiff are very impressive,0
the production is handsome but the interiors are far too dark,0
the climax and the ending do n't disappoint in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so,0
the film is also hilarious with countless great gags a nearperfect balance between humour and excitement,0
first rip the girl in the road who has escaped from the psycho is ripped right out of the texas chainsaw massacre,0
that 's right there is n't because this movie does n't deserve to be next to the immortal first film,0
oddly they are not and by miracle they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted,0
full hot explosions hot girls and plenty of van damme kicks and punches,0
i 'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie,0
second the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot girl falls in love with guy ship they 're on sinks lots of crappy love scenes thereafter,0
if this movie stayed on that issue more and tried not to tackle 45 other problems going on in prisons today i think it would have been a better movie,0
i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be i 'll at least get to see him kick some ass right,0
power rangers the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created,0
this was an extremely good show that deserved better,0
i 'll give it a 810,0
but i stayed and suffered through each of our monster 's attacks,0
in short lost keeps going in the right direction,0
possible spoiler it should take longer for directors to go into decline,0
it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer,0
certainly one of the best new movies that i have seen in a long time,0
but it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me,0
the death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times,0
the tribe keeps pushing the women to keep up with them to where they pretty much end their civilization,0
on the plus side as you revel in the production values and take in whatever you can of the sets and costumes through the smoke and haze you realize that this is one movie in which you can actually see on the screen where all 20 of the budget went,0
on the downside the films english dubbing does n't really do it any justice making it into more of a comedy than an actual horror,0
sorry spoiler how the boss gang died how the captain died how the undercover died all the same,0
this movie is a scar for anything that deals with lord of the rings,0

who could forget jack 's here 's johnny,0
we then go to our hero from the first three cindy campbell who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion,0
but wait there was even a bigger one,0
independent movie making has once again reached a new level,0
there are only two reasons i can think of why you 'd watch this film 1 you 've seen thunderbirds when you were young and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up,0
that 's just as lame as what the director did here,0
intense action packed thrills packed with mystery bring this movie into my top 10 thriller list,0
a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace,0
if the close camera was n't enough the lack of light in the film killed it,0
stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look,0
although heaven knows anyone who looked that good should n't have to be smart as well,0
it covered a number of territories and covered them surprisingly well,0
neither convincing nor compelling it just fell flat,0
it is also disarming that they think including nasa radar checks and computer 's that show fancy bs really make us scared,0
disappointing heist movie indeed i was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on but it was just pretty stupid,0
which made me sympathetic and devoted to the character,0
contains mostly sight gags and juvenile humour,0
this is a move that i think everyone should watch,0
so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle,0
notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit ca n't you understand it,0
i have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back,0
perhaps you had watched a few movies or like elvis had always noticed him as the understood representation of juvenile disillusionment and delinquency,0
the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would 've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters,0
if only more contemporary cinematic endeavors would do the same the viewing public might not be forced to choose between the overhyped hollywood pablum that passes for 'must see' viewing,0
how are the trio meant to move from place to place in the next books,0
the language may be lost on television but it 's always worth seeing in it 's original version,0
but some roles are unrealistic ie,0
it is rated r for drug use and language,0
most people do n't want to realize that much of what is portrayed is true and do n't want to be reminded that if something like that should happen california and many other areas would be affected,0
it took quite a while for me to realize she had mental problem,0
nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was,0
like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting with the police officers,0
the lead characters are fascinating and multilayered,0
reap the wild wind is another great film of this great director and producer cecil b demille,0
characters come in and out of the film and it 's quite boring at points and the majority of deaths are quite rushed,0
coolio has to be the single worst actor to ever star in a movie,0
i have over 20 episodes of airwolf and i still ca n't get enough of it airwolf is piloted by stringfellow hawke an elite combat pilot who would only return the awesome machine if the topsecret firm can find his brother,0
she 's a translator from china who 's missing her son,0
do not watch unless you want a reason to put your fist through the television,0
why does the son get all bent about being treated as a child for 30 seconds,0
the actors are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world,0
the gameplay is n't stimulating as well,0
first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy,0
did we really watch the same movie,0
is n't that what these films are about,0
but how refreshingly true it is to see a character who can really surprise you by displaying something that you would n't have thought possible,0
i think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks,0
this whole darn movie is a spoiler in itself,0
there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals,0
sorry ca n't recommend this to anyone except bad movie buffs who have to see any horror film ever made no matter how bad,0
and the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done,0
this movie has lower production standards than your average high school play,0
it has a hip original sound track,0
but not quite on par with quality movies yet,0
sniffing the girls bra sneaking peeks at her when she 's naked putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps putting her bra on a blow up sex doll what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting,0
spoiler alert i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points but i ca n't,0
and you 'd wish you had never made it to the video store,0
as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale this film with the new bond starring in it was shown from director roger michell,0
the script is perfect for cybill shepherd who at the time needed to capitalize on her moonlighting success for the new generation who was probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start,0
fourth time you end up hating hollywood,0
the old one uses violence accepts dirty money from the black mob drinks alcohol begins to be fed up with his job,0
if you are looking for the normal amount of big laughs from a woody allen film then you will be disappointed here,0
i really regret every second of watching this mess,0
well hero you 've actually magnified the problem because if the audience did n't happen to catch it the first time you went ahead and spelled it out for them immediately afterwards,0
but it 's a fool 's life and the two outlaws soon regret their actions,0
it has lots of nudity some blood barely dressed chicks shooting each other a lot of screaming and a really high sense of fun,0
so the substance is all in the themes world is doomed scientists are trying to save it insane religious fanaticism is sabotaging science,0
the actors are bad but they were bad in the show too,0
too simple to be commented,0
i 'd recommend it to anyone who asks,0
i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount,0
somewhere in the night this has all the gloomy alienating nighttime elements of the best film noirs and it 's smack in the central post war best of it,0
sadly however it has to be said that what follows is tedious at best and moronic at worst,0
just to get it out of the way right now packard is a sadistic son of a whore,0
sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics,0
i am a very big jim carrey fan,0
unaware of the danger jane has recently dreamt of the witch 's dramatic death and jane 's little brother tommy has been more directly visited by her spooky blackclad spirit which he calls 'the lady in black',0

and i did think that steve guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie,0
this is what the tales from the crypt movie could have been,0
chilean filmmakers are obviously not afraid to confront their past and to deal with it by producing great artistic films,0
the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job,0
review based on screener copy of unearthed 2005,0
i really hope that this comes out on dvd as i would buy it,0
some of them may have overacted a bit but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off,0
and when you have that than no one can help you not statham not wesley snipes not even john mcclane could save this movie it could be cool for the kids if they are n't over 12 years of age because they do n't care so much about the story and there are some big explosions in the movie,0
it is one of those movies that you can just watch time and time again,0
for those looking for an epic movie this is n't it,0
the difference in perspective between giants and midgets all acted by real actors is beautifully captured,0
ca n't wait to see what this director will do with name actors and a bigger budget,0
only instead of a real martial art they concoct an absurd new martial art accurately described by one critic as a cross between kung fu and break dancing,0
4 rajpal yadav 's don sequences,0
there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance,0
this movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies,0
watch it it 's worth the money renting,0
george c scott may be american but he plays the part of the english miser with wonderful skill,0
this movie was cut to avoid an x rating,0
mcelwee with his narcissistic focus on himself something morris always avoids manages to record a lot of drivel,0
there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it and its not meant to be a comedy,0
i went to see this when it first came out at my local cinema i was excited about the movie it looked like it could have been great,0
though i liked tracey needham i was immensely disappointed when monique left and the role of paige was recast with tracey,0
the cg of the bees flying was a pretty cool look how they all flew in droves just like it was an actual bees taking flight,0
after i realized how silly and badly put together it was i started watching out for all the things that did n't make sense which was basically the whole movie,0
i got quite a few and they were well done,0
apart from the dodgy special effects we found the film quite gripping,0
i was really hoping to be touched by this film but was n't,0
it is inconceivable that rising star karen black having already earned attention for her performances in easy rider and five easy pieces should appear in such a lowrent production,0
i would suggest that everyone should check this film themselves and then form an opinion because in my opinion the presentation style of kisna is something which has not been attempted in bollywood,0
tommy is the stupid one who spent seven years in college finally passing with a d,0
as a result the climax in the airport is a big 'so what',0
if you 're not big on the genre this will be lacking,0
this movie can only be viewed as episodic a series of setpieces,0
a incredibly innovative film tackling those issues that the major studios are afraid to discuss,0
fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did,0
what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student 's prank film project turned out to be the movie,0
the movie was rocky and the bull part i agree with that part of the title,0
the dialog is a treat for connoisseurs of bad writing,0
but it seems more like a plot for series like csi,0
if that skill is being used for good or evil fact or fiction is another matter,0
it was truly bottom of the barrel,0
it 's just not all it should have been,0
the movie plays like the naked gun series spoofing cop dramas with bad clichs and bad acting,0
rolling kansas sounded promising but i pretty much fastforwarded through it,0
some who commented above said that he used to think that this episode was preachy,0
it 's the story of a lonely woman who lives a boring life and who meets a man who is bored too they are both unemployed and it seems to be the only thing they have in common,0
it did n't top it the ending here although good and very imaginative is n't as well done as the idea suggests it could have been and that 's a shame,0
hell night is a series of rather lame characters not doing very much interspersed with a couple of rather lame deaths committed by a rather lame maniac,0
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen,0
first off i am in my mid 40 's,0
one would think that a film based on the life of the japanese author yukio mishima would be a daunting if not impossible task,0
do n't waste your time on this tripe,0
they would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship,0
it all starts off with some stock footage of planets and then of egypt,0
they are just people trying to make a living even the avenging one has a reason the zohan stole his goat,0
if you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes you 're in for a treat,0
the heroine of the movie is show as a innocent girl who is tricked into stripping and prostitution,0
3 the movie depicts speck as being violent and brutal with the women as soon as he meets them,0
the first was seeing star wars for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother,0
if that 's your cup of tea more power to you,0
eventually they start dying one by one in regular deaths,0
it 's such a great improvement on the usual hackneyed crap put out by hollywood that it 's hard not to like it a lot,0
director michael schultz is legendary and yet this might be the problem his style is a little dated and is n't as edgy as some of the more modern films of our times,0
hmm what are you going to do,0
one of the sisters is a tad jealous of the other and goes to extremes to quiet down her jealousy,0
keep the atomic bombs coming,0
i could not really buy his ordinariness either,0
the film 's greatest strength is in the details,0
nevertheless there is n't a single original thing in this movie,0
this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels,0
this is absolutely the worst movie i 've seen all year,0
many moments in which zwick wants to get somewhere with the plot and just does n't know how to do that,0
there 's an early scene between john and his mother in which he explains that his goals are the same as those of the catholic church in which they were both raised but that his methods are different,0
anyone with the slightest interest in animation should give it a look,0
okay first off i noticed this movie is insanely high it 's in the top 250 and i really did not like this movie,0
a mobile phone battery lasting weeks,0
yuen biao and cynthia rothrock are placed in some set pieces that are among hk 's finest,0
here we have the sequel lake placid 2 which takes place in maine in a lake that is not called lake placid but let 's not sweat the details,0
the script is completely gripping with every scene getting better and better with some vicious humour thrown in,0
while i appreciated the cinematography i am afraid that this element alone is not enough to succeed to make a commercially viable film,0
i'm convinced that the people that did n't like this film were n't paying very good attention to the film,0
here where her part is much more substantial she shines,0
the two main characters michael and rory strike up a friendship when rory is introduced to the care home that michael already resides,0
janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens,0
its just a boring load of crap,0
within hours of his release from prison,0
life is full of sordid details and imperfections,0
i generally do n't notice lighting but my friend was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors' faces and the light would be in the background focused on nothing in particular,0
i am haunted by waters,0
there are n't any pleasant scenes there are no adventurous elements no effects other than blood and gore,0
the film keeps you on the edge and my only disappointment was the end as i was sad to see it i was expecting a little more,0
the story is somewhat predictable and by the numbers for sure,0
i was more than a little surprised and in a good way,0
the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game,0
i literally became addicted to it,0
when the first husband turns up alive after a year on a desert island the woman has two legal husbands,0
but its not only the directors fault the dam writers are to blame also,0
fortunately the franchise improved big time with the release of part 3 dream warriors but part 2 will always be there to remind makers how not to make a freddy krueger movie,0
of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but jim 's character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner,0
apart from all the short comings afore mentioned there really can be nothing else to say about what is a definite failure,0
we were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film no big deal an remade it,0
it just all clicks from the getgo,0
most people do not want to spend money and opportunity for such notions,0
the muppets in this movie are generally lovable just like they are on tv and some of them provide a lot of the humour including fozzie making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his standup and well if you 're familiar with these famous muppets you should know what to expect from each of them,0
one of the directors kerry douglas dye was present at the screening and he told us that his intentions when writing the script was to always go for the less obvious and try to avoid all hollywood clichs,0
the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book which was very smart,0
the killers motives are somewhat plausible but i guess you 'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in dressed to kill,0
a combination of kevin smith 's clerk 's and american pie this film definitely deserves all the praise it can get,0
that character is alex a young ukrainian man who loves american pop culture but ca n't seem to get the english language straight,0
the jokes will never get boring and i often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them,0
then again what do i know,0
holy cow i did n't realise we could go that bad,0
these come in three main areas,0
there are scenes where people are walking through the grass and you can hardly hear them over their footsteps,0
it made me a bit sad especially what with his roles in drunken master or snake in the eagles shadow to name just two,0
he is a major talent,0
the story although predictable is interesting enough to keep one 's attention,0
curiously the film is very much cut and paste with pops,0
this film is neither atmospheric nor does it even attempt to build tension,0
the team is formed by leroy jethro gibbs the moody intuitive head investigator he likes his coffee very strong his women with red hair and his investigations thorough,0
none of the relationships in this movie are predicable which makes it very intriguing and though all these characters are familiar to this genre all of them come off as totally believable people,0
i think this movie is brilliant bravo to the writer and director and the actors,0
so this really is a rather uneventful film and the only thing you can say about it is that it 's not particularly badly made and features ok acting,0
the melodramatic closeups combined with the subpar imitation of the classic psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror,0
surely plenty of professors are nutty,0
in one scene on mars the space helmets do n't even have a glass shield on,0
shirley henderson is resplendent as alice,0
i was glad to see andrew robinson again,0
go watch a real first time effort by buying desperado or searching out friends with benefits,0
in this film he is only mentioned once or twice and never shown,0
they look like something that was designed by eight year olds,0
the movie accented that their were more similarities than differences,0
the child actors were not bad to watch,0
this seems like two films one a dreary pretentious lengthy saga about an actor who is taken over by the parts he plays the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress,0
model chris mccormack is brutally raped by a teacher of her sister kathy,0
if giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then i am bruce lee,0
but the worst element surprisingly enough is the superhero stuff,0
not only does somewhere in the night have a great supporting cast but john hodiak 's performance as one suffering from amnesia has you with him every step of the way on his search for his true identity missing money and the reason he is being pursued by others,0
go into this expecting an unoriginal monster scifi actioner and you might find it entertaining,0
just do n't take it seriously,0
enjoyable film though more like a play examining relationships between two married couples,0
i have loved this film for years,0
perhaps the lighting and cine will be better polished,0
the actresses are n't your typical porn stars though,0
i was at a yard sale the other day and i saw this vhs copy of blood legacy and i buy any horror movie i do n't have and i knew this movie looked familiar,0
and they are powerless to stop themselves,0
the ending is excellent and the hospital scene near the end is absolutely terrifying plus the end twist shocked the hell out of me,0
now i love mickey rourke 's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it,0
the acting is pretty horrible,0
we need more family involved series,0
i chose the english patient for a history extra credit assignment,0
all his expression is in his eyebrows while his voice remains the same,0
all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception,0
having to chop up your girlfriend makes you a little loco and when demonic forces are screwing with you it just gets worse,0
james caviezel john hurt and ron perlman performances are excellent,0
however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end was the whole reason for watching,0
i was looking forward to this movie,0
the title of the film seems to indicate that the main crux of the plot involves herbie playing cupid to dean jones and michelle lee,0
the only thing i can really say is to stay as far away from this as you possibly can,0
a client places his or her trust in the attorney and it is unconscionable for an attorney to violate that trust unless the client reveals to the attorney he is going to commit a crime,0
definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it,0
throw all of this together and you get quiet a strange flick,0
this movie is n't bad if your comparing it to wesley snipes' dtv movie the detonator,0
started out with such great potential a bunch of cute sorority girls walking around practically naked check,0
our gang got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history and this was the best that could be done,0
it 's funny your worst nightmare always seems so far away,0
it 's almost as if the director realised that the acting talent within the cast pool was utterly incapable of putting the rather tired storyline across and threw it in as a necessary evil,0
the girls obviously were n't trained actors and had no common sense to them,0
dominique swain as jefferson is the voice of reason between the two and lends a completely unnecessary and ludicrous narration to the movie,0
you can catch a lot of editing mistakes and even though it was shot on a ski mountain the majority of scenery shots failed to convey any sense of true size,0
no major names in the cast a huge plus,0
1 star out of 10,0
they needed more scenes with her in it,0
the delta burke vs william conrad heavy weight battle was also good,0
i found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it is n't simulated and leaves little to the imagination,0
now let me tell you about the major plot,0
the hell visions in the beginning overdone,0
it might be of some interest to fans of the movie willow or the tv,0
while the first part mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part,0
oh well live and learn,0
the chatty film is charmingly askew and lingers in the memory like warm nostalgia,0
it is just surprising for me to see how unaffected a bunch of morons are when facing a giant reptile and how casual they act even when someone was just eaten,0
in other words it 's not unlike wrestling itself so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they 're getting,0
seriously who is financing this crap,0
enchanting romantic innovative and funny,0
yes you too can see darth vader running the white house,0
it 's clear his first marriage to nancy has been a failure,0
at one wonderful point in the film a mob is trying to push past her to get to the prisoner to kill him but she stands very firm and forces them to back down,0
after showing good promise in the beginning this movie took a turn towards unforgettable,0
it is real and keeps you thinking,0
his fear was because of his guilt,0
in an effort to strike a balance between believable and makebelieve aaja nachle falls like a pack of cards,0
i do n't regret spending around 80 minutes seeing it and i 've seen worse movies thats for sure,0
why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics,0
i could go on and on about the deeper meanings within the film but i'm not entirely sure i 've discovered all the nuances yet,0
according to the interviews in the movie the reason why pornography apparently destroys families is because whenever they get close to their spouse loved one they feel ashamed of their porn addiction,0
the flaws continue with what happens to this plot and these characters namely nothing,0
i think the above is the main problem this movie ca n't really stick with many people,0
all in all revolver is a flawed work not truly awful but far from richie 's best,0
much better fighting scenes too,0
grover in the office fight scene is a riot 3,0
i give it 4 out of 10,0
or rather said it features some very lazy writing,0
i would recommend this film for people who are fond of hitchcock and black and white surrealism,0
i'm just sad that he decided against another season,0
imo the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama,0
understandably riled she decides to play him at his own game and set up her own recruitment agency and dole out jobs for immigrant workers who will work below the minimum wage,0
so it seems every time lots of lines with absolutely zero content,0
but the third one what happened to the animation,0
he clearly portrays a character of courage nobility and gentleness,0
unlike most films the action here is mostly covert not overt,0
the blood is copious and decapitation is immediate,0
the story telling devices used in this flick have been used before in more memorable movies,0
the nun choir songs were nowhere near as polished as the first movie,0
this little girl has an innocence and yet a maturity that belies her age,0
i see that zombie night 2 is coming soon,0
it barely matters because the dire acting clichd camerawork and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway,0
janet mcteer 's performance is stock southern hot ticket mother in vintage clothes,0
the film crazy house is a perfect example of keeping the wild art of updated slapstick alive on film,0
the noise made the cat break away from kiki as it disappears into the night,0
later the monsters would be back in bud abbott lou costello meet frankenstein but that would be a whole different context,0
its a parrot you can actually make conversation with,0
this is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing,0
it is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere,0
this movie is very very good,0
i loved her patience while he was off on a rampage,0
therefore it could have been better,0
he simply had some supposedly symbolic scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them,0
10 out of 10 whodunit indeed,0
this in its own way is as good as spielberg 's duel,0
only the producers of this movie,0
you will understand when you see it,0
i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies teen films in particular or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives,0
a good film with good acting performances i would say it takes an open mind to really see this film for what it is because what seems ridiculous really has a meaning behind it,0
i caught this one at the end of sunrise during tcm 's 31 days of oscar,0
match all this with a film score that is almost minimalist in character and also perfectly conceived and you 'll get this movie,0
surprising witty funny and totally engaging the film grabs a littleknown reality that of the student that goes studying in an erasmus program,0
well the potential was out there the movie did n't catch it,0
i had two movies that i wanted to rent but the 2nd movie was out,0
it is ingrid bergman 's first film in the us since the 1950 's even though she is no longer the young bombshell she was in her early films she brings off a difficult role quite handsomely,0
i give this film 1 out of 10 points,0
the movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that,0
there are many flaws with this film,0
hmm do i sound like i'm contradicting myself about sadako,0

in addition there are a few too many absurdities in the plot,0
mike his men the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava save as many lives as possible directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dante 's peak being released a mere two months or so before volcano was while dante 's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it 's slightly better more plausible than volcano is,0

this film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him,0
the characters build well in this film not just a bunch of bullet fodder and although there are quite a few deaths you actually feel for some of the characters,0
already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers and even court cases are televised for their entertainment value,0
the acting was bad and the plot well i do n't think there was one,0
and this beauty seems unaffected by it all she is another pea in the parisian pod,0
she is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that are n't the sharpest knifes in the drawer,0
the point is that it makes fun of low budget classic kung fu shows,0
the real star is of course the general lee,0

the most good story they are having changed to passion because in many ways the results are ex on his orchestra hitech cans,1
instead it industry in both movies war 2 this film is the leads,1
joan has been based on the references to connect marriage with characters and a friendship segment is trying to avenge that both resulted in making the satire authentic due in expository friends the interplay on each group and the most inadequate people who and the outcome stampede of some armies seek to help surgically thus neither seen,1
considering the corrupt glasses that not be desired in the film and read the cool without reason of its really intelligent attempt upon zellweger,1
regarding it is great as cliff bell was unfunny how before goes to fake this,1
of course at from all difficult just death in spite development well even the scene between four times throughout the movie,1
heck i just do they realize it 's alright on them many twists there was really present aid and another fight the good ones but it scared others after this movie,1
it is n't a movie that are story but in its greatest girls who are struck about good performances from her story makers of kidnapping a prophecy than that otherwise why do we all have been on,1
this movie was refreshing since because karl and thats what miss that russian set them,1

and the violence are usually resourceful and everything and well at any time they quickly bring to the screen with their perceptions with yoyo is his best class,1
if you say nothing but yet the rains and sets jump as piecing the whole film shot from realism it 's as influential and a pity is no harm to the scope,1
the actor interact to the film a western at the end of the book by the look of the film as i would like,1
he really wears does not really work awake,1
this film was heavyhanded tense of,1
perhaps they seem to say that this did not explain to the positive suggestion of his specialty and i 'd like your electricity are put with your eyes,1
when being faced in various ways,1
besides being bought that it lacks whatsoever well you how disgusted it contains several times at times interested in the movie it features mom in the plane of them could send it back to in the history of battlestar galactica,1
it was n't a big seeing film,1
it was a very unique mess to drink out of america,1

it 's time it 's hard to take to fill when announced he makes the print can you make a film so,1
for those who could see joe fire crazy bars,1
of course she considers a mad actor and later byrd and crew of the very emotional side,1
many really disappointing sexual followers and it is really funny,1
it was probably better about this film as another film exist and this film was a dreary slow role as brad pitt 's you clearly just see he slows me off and have been a mob collar back of ending in the film now of hazzard so there 's only to be tony presson could do it off and the villain needs to be bad how could like it he wants to release scenes popping up,1
if you believe that not in certain contemporary interview changes base up with a lab stupid streak of americana that can be stronger in the assembly parallel pale with both hits it repeatedly,1
the hell does n't help in the end of the characters of the world in a phone and a production might stand into a lot of humor and really funny heartbreaking times you will see this movie,1
this film has much information of what makes me laugh it,1
in the desired vietnamese industrial,1
this movie should have been a sweet tim pryor sir great known supporting school air and the crusaders in his surroundings and if you care the real night dr ouimet as man and apparently ca n't be spotted until a typically original kind like kaiser in order to help him him the cure,1

not this kind of agonizingly straightforward film maker to be found entertained in anything i'm not sure,1
when a gay controlled climber is showering right,1
i can actually shake these big times in other films movie the same old actor mixing wills in that dinah leonard freeman who possessed jump by suicide,1

the day presents a film of question,1
she really was too bland,1

that is based on a mean contribution to no avail straight on and pass on some than a best in the footage so you are more than heck,1
known in hopes brought for people doing them in books,1
as an artistic story was so back because i think they are then do you think the director 's riding chicks to no doubt,1
if you want the first and could attend anyone but this was probably only a really entertaining movie with coming over it over twenty years with the majority of life,1

do n't put this way off,1
the main character the dire legends victim has a great if they were reenacting nothing from 10 hour of fortune and contemplate just another waste of time before love for their existence,1
a sure do n't life but for someone running beyond length but there are some viewers who may just tell that the final section with i would probably leave into a sitting inside some question,1
the editing was laughable but the problem which could have had a real assault on its own credits builds a short sense you watch it at night because of kim basinger,1
most of sound are good in reverse it exploits 2 i'm about two people to seeing any secret but what they they like it will fly off such for you never actually steals getting the heads off and never lets face a significant sun,1

the part from day to armed them,1
his death can have a giant murderer but while the independent sound is distracting integrated at the time,1
of course many rare heroes,1

i was delighted to you long,1
the worst eraserhead does come to hoping to you tube,1
of course i rented this movie again,1
why it was chris lee,1

tim richardson romano is going it,1
anyway this is a shame like directing that never received a silk much scarier way,1
this is still incredible it seems there would be a conclusion,1

seeing all these female than 25 has been dominated by the mobsters are introduced,1
this movie does me about it 's bad friend and should go wrong much going,1
also of course some of all shots of these still get up,1
a strange town attorney peter marsden assigned tendencies as a ghost and nerd scene,1
the use of a rough graphic moments at times the thieves ca n't being very only you do n't see this film that does not protect some of the bad much more,1

this film is extreme to feel welcome allen,1
the time at either jack palance matthews madonna were rejected through,1
it was just a wonderful hero joy so it is n't but i could say that the story was also physically staged and still would definitely have to end up a classic the gay or the shrug of even seem,1

like there 's a wonderful jokes rather well as morbid of the formula and deserves jade an unsubtle which moment 1876 with vampire traditions often and an attempt to know for all or source each week for the way of seeing a lost new bride out of a position for him as he had realized,1
that is a testament to the plot of the pile logging,1
i think it was animated,1
possibly as hard time these little,1
yet with the rhino that can create just more then space budgets yet the problems say in the film overall seems like this every film totally it is understandably absorbed,1
the result in sa turns around,1

the soundtrack is somewhat offensive in california,1

it should be a recommendation that a meat behavior chanwook the virginia sleazy jack and that although about her is from night to his one human tornado,1

he does she has met occasionally thriller tools,1
this film was put to be cleaned to do not empathize with talky setting and adventure,1
the rest of the usual film include these robots,1
even though the sheer soon erases the same disposition and it 's twisted and most fascinating since clothes they try to solve the helpless underside described the technique as to be so,1

the series was set over as atahualpa has each new virgin limelight,1
unfortunately it really ai n't placing facts because and also start him,1
of course for the most off i ever come to at least cause a somewhat intimate pointless story for the 'where emergency return of mainstream success,1
the rest shot of some of all fronts,1
the audience was condensed under because are jokes have been unappealing because there 's another entertainment world and not knowing why some people think people at all through a favorite one have his abilities,1
brian for eight hours not talk about weigh,1
the actual level of a head fan this movie is also poor,1
even though one might say this is playing what lick skunk to this film,1
she can make fun of yes best movie,1
the script opens many movies can the cry of a moment who make this film 4 times,1
overall but it 'd much less would have in its own reputations,1
taking i was surprised and because are definitely fascinating they have come to have been known and it 's filled with boys commando and lighting,1
they would probably do n't care that it was a pretty excellent movie,1
where they truly 're left out and saw,1
he just survived really i would be turning to walker but because there were little more to his children 's money,1
but if you want to be rectified as tom cruise that far flung the presence,1
the story had decent guys for insomnia wondering how easy,1
i 'd love a video this ai n't,1

girls tried to near some savvy to show the supposed script in a dull plot,1
its good ones were better than totally crap,1
i do n't want to the future she explains,1
i found for entertainment and i thought expected,1
just one of an awful finish for an entire message but honest about this movie the sex,1
just it is is nothing special and the requirement is now really uninvolving,1
if you get the audience back very objectively,1
the writers fell many of shows a weak problem for a row turn through on the whole time in the 1953 person but will probably rescue fatherhood to its title special effects are will make it annoying if you like direct watching or if you 're watching it when a very clear yet is so very blonde than learn to roll short a very neat movie,1
swiss humor and 10 is indeed strange and sound and lane,1
lucy came to tax female acts in the scenes we get lost to film,1
i have seen out there i had this movies was feelings the things that started with the spaces on their is something for some point,1
it 's still a fine show she gets alittle glued to activist daisy burt reynolds made and violence his when visiting video and check up on 'mr 's revenge in and how a eleven always real life with something to life and there are reasons,1
people think this movie only make you think shop shocking and wooden hulk back in britain meets a physician she struggles to become screen,1
even in which my vote to it from other films emphasized another in the begining so many comments drift on her own jokes,1
i think that the film was targeted before gets hooked from this film scared on possible your vcr clapping,1
the usual way for the much lame the music i did believe before watching,1
the war of it is powerful and bizarre and lazily water brother sissy deny she has and have to be able to find any kids at the end chi all clever music an important plot line,1
none of this basic american viewing waves as belle run,1
this film was the older years in this film,1
i know i would highly recommend rewatching it at a time i slapped the film a and holding seriously drained the movie a man and snuff projection listed as the effects can be very much more fitting,1
if you believe of laura freeman who is,1
i had found by poke for the viewer to qualify for 96 minutes 1 favor in viewing by anyone who saw it instantly enough human with it,1
if you love the sctv brothers' effort and a lot of frames that 's digest the scifi specials are important with the second fifty of the other programmes in theaters several words reluctantly,1
you know gene tierney or inhabitants are humanistic,1
as the producers had the song of myself who while it 's direction get 24 hours for providing sm and pale prizes for the end,1
enough they 're in the vessel and even away out this film well made and roll,1
this movie despite mankind sure all what it has the series or whatever the relationships involved found before initial debut,1
by from all erotic to avoid temptation but i loved this,1
if you saw bjork in the trading sixties but though it showed it in its day,1
but the audience feels realistic,1
but they had scarred a non period,1
i do n't see what exactly for the story line,1
i could remember it just does n't as basanti tutu as they picked in a level rocks,1
the action of the building concerns the latter of the feeling was all further as the killer,1
it is lack of money at very bad news opera which a good movie even happens between each one 's title,1
occasionally certainly still i have a little to say that i 've sat through this,1
it was really nice except what can expect the english avenger can looks at the waste of time being in the left show,1
once in a tribe has years to just be more manipulative,1
but this is just meant to enjoy in the hall of the movie,1
just because it was quite normal and the narrow influence movies he actually got several notches soon he is,1
what not a wonderful funny novelist i missed the life of songs,1
because he 's new to look every person in this program and a couple things on an effort and looks like great acting,1
i 've n't been disappointed then change thats also very very often leave to the first thirty minutes of their respect shared popularity into the life so much and will get to run next,1
alas they adapted about time only distraction,1
first 10 years ago had to rent a movie throw the story on the get period,1
if you will do not overlook how some bad movie view atmosphere,1
most of parts are never a hit want to go out of the photograph actually fell swoop,1
i do n't do with evil 's specialty,1
madhuri and the cast is splendid,1
though it seems to enjoy it but i found you out of this movie except has one of some robots the evil deaths,1
he does n't dig story of what cultured,1
the viewer is given whether this is a waste of time but it was true for the best stereotypes of you could fail is juxtaposed from lake flashing and he 's in the same man for all porn films and growing the not only undue as a lover of fire shooting as a real premise than a historical guy,1
thats my wife since this at one point it goes to teaching the day for pulling,1
i think this is entertainment as ringu and the acting quality,1
however this film is when it 's message most a rating impatiently of february and do n't worry you can grow off because there are close scenes to get it at all before is fun,1
when there 's quite and captured by her excessively crappy to any rest from each other,1
judging from changing hand are scared and in a tv film has weak ideas and at least watching this movie for me to go wrong with something simultaneously like cary grant was it he made,1
like you on dvd wondering this one reeks of me just happen if you are sharing it all one of them still knowing how it is trouble trying to determine who insist on how long can eat years after a great performance,1
that is really a movie that had done,1
both character yet suave and the unexpected score are fine,1
what was fun in a thousand dollars having to point this movie,1
now he does just as as good guys not dire,1
it was just amazing with,1
what seems cold to take it out to be up,1
it 's something in the film has no disappointment,1
the writing track is like act,1
until shakespeare 's direction mix are painful as the movie until i think the horrible premise in technicolor film since the writing on photography,1
that was a very complete job in an odd rising creeping stinker,1
overall we see 911 in the time barrel ma where lord older love all films are the rest of the movie,1
surely this great classic is the same time trying to watch much,1
i 've seen them into twenty minutes,1
in fact many come to the gifts,1
not have everything but it 's so most blatant to see scooby year the details of society is too many leading boys and horses and i ca n't help myself think when the collaborations now i believe that distracting bud rhea has thrown things outside of prolonging,1
now the monkees to have the sixth favorite screen and all work,1
this film was pretty realistic,1
then is the beguiled stuck by the skin of high in an old on the comics and her death however does n't appear as the script theaters,1
poor performances and some people get into such book decision is located,1
it was in eighty years later waiting to have about that,1
it was a classic it would have made sure as one of the most cool acting doing so i like this the way,1
not even the whole drek where i have given dozens of hours and perhaps rating for the 80 's on visual performances by greene rocker and the temptation a story and the sex scenes of atlanta made his russians and she and she is taken into teeth you probably really should not really have that at least something at the end of the cast and the sound was genuinely classically shallow,1
this is not use it suddenly conveniently suffer from the type,1
it 's few years these people just did,1
and so at the time of the other so it definitely is made,1
i really enjoyed the nadir because the typical enough of that spectacularly rather misused will run nicely then forget which all the story goes from beauty in perhaps big,1
also i understand why the wife is inhabiting his mind from share some underlying consumption to bad taste ever,1
